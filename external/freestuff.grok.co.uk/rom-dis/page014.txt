Note: The value '437,500/f' gives the 'half-cycle' length of the note and reducing it by '30.125' allows for '120.5' T states in which to actually produce the note and adjust the counters etc.
The values can now be transferred to the required registers.

		CALL	1E99,FIND-INT2	The 'timing loop' value is
				compressed into the BC
		PUSH	BC	register pair; and saved.

Note: If the timing loop value is too large then an error will occur (returning via ERROR-1); thereby excluding 'pitch' values of '+70 to +127'.

		CALL	1E99,FIND-INT2	The 'f*t' value is compressed
				into the BC register pair.
		POP	HL	Move the 'timing loop' value to
				the HL register pair.
		LD	D,B	Move the 'f*t' value to the
		LD	E,C	DE register pair.

However before making the 'beep' test the value 'f*t'.

		LD	A,D	Return if 'f*t' has given the
		OR	E	result of 'no cycles'
		RET	Z	required.
		DEC	DE	Decrease the cycle number and
		JP	03B5,BEEPER	jump to the BEEPER subroutine
				(making, at least, one pass).
