THE 'COSINE' FUNCTION
(Offset 20: 'cos')

This subroutine handles the function COS X and returns a 'last value' 'that is an approximation to COS X.
The subroutine uses the expression:
COS X = SIN (PI*W/2), where -1 <=W <=1.
In deriving W for X the subroutine uses the test result obtained in the previous subroutine and stored for this purpose in mem-0. It then jumps to the SINE, subroutine, entering at C-ENT, to produce a 'last value' of COS X.

THE 'SINE' FUNCTION
(Offset 1F: 'sin')

This subroutine handles the function SIN X and is the third of the four routines that use SERIES GENERATOR to produce Chebyshev polynomials.
The approximation to SIN X is found as follows:

i. The argument X is reduced and in this case W = V directly.
