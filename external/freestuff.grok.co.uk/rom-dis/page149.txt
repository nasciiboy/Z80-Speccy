		RST 	0018,GET-CHAR 	Get the present character.
		POP 	HL 	Restore the 'length'.
		CP 	+CC 	Is the present character a 'TO'?
		JR 	Z,2A81,SL-SECOND 	Jump forward to consider the
				second parameter if it is so;
				CP +29 otherwise show that there is
2A7A 	SL-RPT -C 	JP 	NZ,1C8A,REPORT-C 	a closing bracket.

At this point a 'slice' of a single character has been identified. e.g. - A$(4).

		LD 	H,D 	The last character of the 'slice'
		LD 	L,E 	is also the first character.
		JR 	2A94,SL-DEFINE 	Jump forward.

The second parameter of a 'slice' is now evaluated.

2A81 	SL-SECOND 	PUSH 	HL 	Save the 'length' briefly.
		RST 	0020,NEXT-CHAR 	Get the next character.
		POP 	HL 	Restore the 'length'.
		CP 	+29 	Is the present character a
				')'?
		JR 	Z,2A94,SL-DEFINE 	Jump if there is not a
				second parameter.
		POP 	AF 	If the first parameter was in
				range A will hold zero;
				otherwise +FF.
		CALL 	2ACD,INT-EXP2 	Make BC hold the second
				parameter.
		PUSH 	AF 	Save the 'error register'.
		RST 	0018,GET-CHAR 	Get the present character.
		LD 	H,B 	Pass the result obtained from
		LD 	L,C 	INT-EXP2 to the HL register
				pair.
		CP 	+29 	Check that there is a closing
		JR 	NZ,2A7A,SL-RPT-C 	bracket now.

The 'new' parameters are now defined.

2A94 	SL-DEFINE 	POP 	AF 	Fetch the 'error register'.
		EX 	(SP),HL 	The second parameter goes on
				the stack and the 'start' goes to
				HL.
		ADD 	HL,DE 	The first parameter is added
				to the 'start'.
		DEC 	HL 	Go back a location to get it
				correct.
		EX 	(SP),HL 	The 'new start' goes on the
				stack and the second parameter
				goes to HL.
		AND 	A 	Subtract the first parameters
		SBC 	HL,DE 	from the second to find the
				length of the 'slice'.
		LD 	BC,+0000 	Initialise the 'new length'.
		JR 	C,2AA8,SL-OVER 	A negative 'slice' is a 'null
				string' rather than an error
				condition. (See manual.)
		INC 	HL 	Allow for the inclusive byte.
		AND 	A 	Only now test the 'error
				register'.
		JP 	M,2A20,REPORT-3 	Jump if either parameter was
				out of range for the string.
		LD 	B,H 	Transfer the 'new length'
		LD 	C,L 	to BC.
2AA8 	SL+OVER 	POP 	DE 	Get the 'new start'.
		RES 	6,(FLAGS) 	Ensure that a string is still
				indicated.
