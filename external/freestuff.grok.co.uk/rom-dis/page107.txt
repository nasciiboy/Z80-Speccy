THE 'PRINT A CARRIAGE RETURN' SUBROUTINE
1FF5	PRINT-CR	CALL	1FC3,UNSTACK-Z	Return if changing syntax.
		LD	A,+0D	Print a carriage return
		RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	character and then return.
		RET

THE 'PRINT ITEMS' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine is called from the PRINT, LPRINT and INPUT command routines.
The various types of print item are identified and printed.
1FFC	PR-ITEM-1	RST	0018,GET-CHAR	The first character is fetched.
		CP	+AC	Jump forward unless it is
		JR	NZ,200E,PR-ITEM-2	an 'AT'.
Now deal with an 'AT'.
		CALL	1C79,NEXT-2NUM	The two parameters are trans-
				ferred to the calculator stack.
		CALL	1FC3,UNSTACK-Z	Return now if checking syntax.
		CALL	2307,STK-TO-BC	The parameters are compressed
				into the BC register pair.
		LD	A,+16	The A register is loaded with
		JR	201E,PR-AT-TAB	the AT control character before
				the jump is taken.
Next look for a 'TAB'.
200E	PR-ITEM-2	CP	+AD	Jump forward unless it is
		JR	NZ,2024,PR-ITEM-3	a 'TAB'.
Now deal with a 'TAB'.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the next character.
		CALL	1C82,EXPT-1NUM	Transfer one parameter to the
				calculator stack.
		CALL	1FC3,UNSTACK-Z	Return now if checking syntax.
		CALL	1E99,FIND-INT2	The value is compressed into the
				BC register pair.
		LD	A,+17	The A register is loaded with the
				TAB control character.
The 'AT' and the 'TAB' print items are printed by making three calls to PRINT-OUT.
201E	PR-AT-TAB	RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	Print the control character.
		LD	A,C	Follow it with the first
		RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	value.
		LD	A,B	Finally print the second
		RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	value; then return.
		RET
Next consider embedded colour items.
2024	PR-ITEM-3	CALL	21F2,CO-TEMP-3	Return with carry reset if a
				coour items was found.
		RET	NC	Continue if none were found.
		CALL	2070,STR-ALTER	Next consider if the stream is
				to be changed.
		RET	NC	Continue unless it was altered.
The print item must now be an expression, either numeric or string.
		CALL	24FB,SCANNING	Evaluate the expression but
		CALL	1FC3,UNSTACK-Z	return now if checking syntax.
		BIT	6,(FLAGS)	Test for the nature of the
				expression.
		CALL	Z,2BF1,STK-FETCH	If it is string then fetch the nec-
				essary parameters; but if it is
		JP	NZ,2DE3,PRINT-FP	numeric then exit via PRINT-FP.
