		BIT	7,(HL)	Continue if the set is 'free' but
		RET	Z	exit from the KEYBOARD
				subroutine if not.

The new key is to be accepted. But before the system variable LAST-K can be filled, the KSTATE system variables, of the set being used, have to be initialised to handle any repeats and the key's code has to be decoded.

02F1	K-NEW	LD	E,A	The code is passed to the
		LD	(HL),A	E register and to KSTATE0/4.
		INC	HL	The '5 call counter' for this
		LD	(HL),+05	set is reset to '5'.
		INC	HL	The third system variable of
		LD	A,(REPDEL)	the set holds the REPDEL value
		LD	(HL),A	(normally 0.7 secs.).
		INC	HL	Point to KSTATE3/7.

The decoding of a 'main code' depends upon the present state of MODE, bit 3 of FLAGS and the 'shift byte'.

		LD	C,(MODE)	Fetch MODE.
		LD	D,(FLAGS)	Fetch FLAGS.
		PUSH	HL	Save the pointer whilst the
		CALL	0333,K-DECODE	'main code' is decoded.
		POP	HL
		LD	(HL),A	The final code value is saved in
				KSTATE3/7; from where it is
				collected in case of a repeat.

The next three instruction lines are common to the handling of both 'new keys' and 'repeat keys'.

0308	K-END	LD	(LAST-K),A	Enter the final code value into
		SET	5,(FLAGS)	LAST-K and signal 'a new key'.
		RET		Finally return.

THE 'REPEATING KEY' SUBROUTINE
A key will 'repeat' on the first occassion after the delay period - REPDEL (normally 0.7 secs.) and on subsequent occassions after the delay period - REPPER (normally 0.1 secs.).

0310	K-REPEAT	INC	HL	Point to the '5 call counter'
		LD	(HL),+05	of the set being used and reset
				it to '5'.
		INC	HL	Point to the third system vari-
		DEC	(HL)	able - the REPDEL/REPPER
				value, and decrement it.
		RET	NZ	Exit from the KEYBOARD
				subroutine if the delay period
				has not passed.
		LD	A,(REPPER)	However once it has passed the
		LD	(HL),A	delay period for the next repeat
				is to be REPPER.
		INC	HL	The repeat has been accepted
		LD	A,(HL)	so the final code value is fetched
				from KSTATE3/7 and passed
		JR	0308,K-END	to K-END.

THE 'K-TEST' SUBROUTINE
The key value is tested and a return made if 'no-key' or 'shift-only'; otherwise the 'main code' for that key is found.

031E	K-TEST	LD	B,D	Copy the shift byte.
		LD	D,+00	Clear the D register for later.
		LD	A,E	Move the key number.
		CP	+27	Return now if the key was
		RET	NC	'CAPS SHIFT' only or 'no-key'.
