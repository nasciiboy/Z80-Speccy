THE FLOATING-POINT CALCULATOR

THE TABLE OF CONSTANTS
This first table holds the five useful and frequently needed numbers zero, one, a half, a half of pi and ten. The numbers are held in a condensed form which is expanded by the STACK LITERALS subroutine, see below, to give the required floating-point form.
		data:	constant	when expanded gives:
				exp. mantissa: (Hex.)
32C5	stk-zero	DEFB +00	zero	00 00 00 00 00
		DEFB +B0
		DEFB +00

32C8	stk-one	DEFB +40	one	00 00 01 00 00
		DEFB +B0
		DEFB +00
		DEFB +01

32CC	stk-half	DEFB +30	a half	80 00 00 00 00
		DEFB +00

32CE	stk-pi/2	DEFB +F1	a half of pi	81 49 0F DA A2
		DEFB +49
		DEFB +0F
		DEFB +DA
		DEFB +A2

32D3	stk-ten	DEFB +40	ten	00 00 0A 00 00
		DEFB +B0
		DEFB +00
		DEFB +0A


THE TABLE OF ADDRESSES:
This second table is a look-up table of the addresses of the sixty-six operational subroutines of the calculator. The offsets used to index into the table are derived either from the operation codes used in SCANNING, see 2734, etc., or from the literals that follow a RST 0028 instruction.
