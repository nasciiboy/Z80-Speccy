		LD	(ERR-NR),+FF	Cancel the error number and
		LD	D,+00	give a 'rasp' before going
		LD	E,(RASP)	around the editor again.
		LD	HL,+1A90
		CALL	0385,BEEPER
		JP	0F30,ED-AGAIN

THE 'CLEAR-SP' SUBROUTINE
The editing area or the work space is cleared as directed.

1097	CLEAR-SP	PUSH	HL	Save the pointer to the space.
		CALL	1190,SET-HL	DE will point to the first
				character and HL the last.
		DEC	HL	The correct amount is now
		CALL	19E5,RECLAIM-1	reclaimed.
		LD	(K-CUR),HL	The system variables K-CUR
		LD	(MODE),+00	and MODE ('K mode') are
		POP	HL	initialised before fetching
		RET		the pointer and returning.

THE 'KEYBOARD INPUT' SUBROUTINE
This important subroutine returns the code of the last key to have bean pressed but note that CAPS LOCK, the changing of the mode and the colour control parameters are handled within the subroutine.

10A8	KEY-INPUT	BIT 	3,(TV-FLAG) 	Copy the edit-linear the
		CALL	NZ,111D,ED-COPY	INPUT-line to the screen if
				the mode has changed.
		AND	A	Return with both carry
		BIT 	5,(FLAGS) 	and zero flags reset if no
		RET 	Z 	new key has been pressed
		LD  	A,(LAST-K)  	Otherwise fetch the code and
		RES 	5,(FLAGS) 	signal that it has been taken
		PUSH	AF	Save the code temporarily.
		BIT  	5,(TV-FLAG)  	Clear the lower part of the
		CALL	NZ,0D6E,CLS-LOWER display if necessary;
				e.g. after 'scroll?';
		POP	AF	Fetch the code.
		CP	+20	Accept all characters and
		JR	NC,111B,KEY-DONE	token codes.
		CP	+10	Jump forward with most of
		JR	NC,10FA,KEY-CONTR	the control character codes.
		CP	+06	Jump forward with the 'mode'.
		JR	NC,10DB,KEY=M&CL	codes and the CAPS LOCK code.

Now deal with the FLASH, BRIGHT& INVERSE codes.

		LD	B,A	Save the code.
		AND	+01	Keep only bit 0.
		LD	C,A	C holds +00 (= OFF) or
				C holds +01 (= ON).
		LD	A,B	Fetch the code.
		RRA		Rotate it once (losing bit 0).
		ADD	A,+12	Increase it by +12 giving for
		JR	1105,KEY-DATA	FLASH - +12, BRIGHT - +13
				and INVERSE - +14.

The CAPS LOCK code and the mode codes are dealt with 'locally'.

10DB	KEY-M&CL	JR	NZ,10E6,KEY-MODE	Jump forward with 'mode' codes.
		LD	HL,+5C6A	This is FLAGS2.
		LD	A,+08	Flip bit 3 of FLAGS2. This is
		XOR	(HL)	the CAPS LOCK flag.
		LD	(HL),A
		JR	10F4,KEY-FLAG	Jump forward.
10E6	KEY-MODE	CP	+0E	Check the lower limit.
