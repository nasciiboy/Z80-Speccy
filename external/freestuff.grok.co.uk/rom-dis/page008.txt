		CP	+18	Jump forward unless the 'E'
		JR	NZ,032C,K-MAIN	key was SYMBOL SHIFT.
		BIT	7,B	However accept SYMBOL SHIFT
		RET	NZ	and another key; return with
				SYMBOL SHIFT only.

The 'main code' is found by indexing into the main key table.

032C	K-MAIN	LD	HL,+0205	The base address of the table.
		ADD	HL,DE	Index into the table and fetch
		LD	A,(HL)	the 'main code'.
		SCF		Signal 'valid keystroke'
		RET		before returning.

THE 'KEYBOARD DECODING' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine is entered with the 'main code' in the E register, the value of FLAGS in the D register, the value of MODE in the C register and the 'shift byte' in the B register.
By considering these four values and referring, as necessary, to the six key tables a 'final code' is produced. This is returned in the A register.

0333	K-DECODE	LD	A,E	Copy the 'main code'.
		CP	+3A	Jump forward if a digit key is
		JR	C,0367,K-DIGIT	being considered; also SPACE,
				ENTER & both shifts.
		DEP	C	Decrement the MODE value.
		JP	M,034F,K-KLC-LET	Jump forward, as needed, for
		JR	Z,0341,K-E-LET	modes 'K', 'L', 'C' & 'E'.

Only 'graphics' mode remains and the 'final code' for letter keys in graphics mode is computed from the 'main code'.

		ADD	A,+4F	Add the offset.
		RET		Return with the 'final code'.

Letter keys in extended mode are considered next.

0341	K-E-LET	LD	HL,+01EB	The base address for table 'b'.
		INC	B	Jump forward to use this table
		JR	Z,034A,K-LOOK-UP	if neither shift key is being
				pressed.
		LD	HL,+0205	Otherwise use the base address
				for table 'c'.

Key tables 'b-f' are all served by the following look-up routine. In all cases a 'final code' is found and returned.

034A	K-LOOK-UP	LD	D,+00	Clear the D register.
		ADD	HL,DE	Index the required table
		LD	A,(HL)	and fetch the 'final code'.
		RET		Then return.

Letter keys in 'K', 'L' or 'C' modes are now considered. But first the special SYMBOL SHIFT codes have to be dealt with.

034F	K-KLC-LET	LD	HL,+0229	The base address for table 'e'
		BIT	0,B	Jump back if using the SYMBOL
		JR	Z,034A,K-LOOK-UP	SHIFT key and a letter key.
		BIT	3,D	Jump forward if currently in
		JR	Z,0364,K-TOKENS	'K' mode.
		BIT	3,(FLAGS2)	If CAPS LOCK is set then
		RET	NZ	return with the 'main code'
		INC	B	Also return in the same manner
		RET	NZ	if CAPS SHIFT is being pressed.
		ADD	A,+20	However if lower case codes are
		RET		required then +20 has to be
				added to the 'main code' to give
				the correct 'final code'.

The 'final code' values for tokens are found by adding +A5 to the 'main code'.
