0364	K-TOKENS	ADD	A,+A5	Add the required offset and
		RET		return.

Next the digit keys; and SPACE, ENTER & both shifts; are considered.

0367	K-DIGIT	CP	+30	Proceed only with the digit keys.
		RET	C	i.e. Return with SPACE (+20),
				ENTER (+0D) & both shifts
				(+0E).
		DEC	C	Now separate the digit keys into
				three groups - according to the
				mode.
		JP	M,039D,K-KLC-DGT	Jump with 'K', 'L' & 'C' modes;
		JR	NZ,0389,K-GRA-DGT	and also with 'G' mode.
				Continue with 'E' mode.
		LD	HL,+0254	The base address for table 'f'.
		BIT	5,B	Use this table for SYMBOL
		JR	Z,034A,K-LOOK-UP	SHIFT & a digit key in
				extended mode.
		CP	+38	Jump forward with digit keys
		JR	NC,0382,K-8-&-9	'8' and '9'.

The digit keys '0' to '7' in extended mode are to give either a 'paper colour code' or an 'ink colour code' depending on the use of the CAPS SHIFT.

		SUB	+20	Reduce the range +30 to +37
				giving +10 to +17.
		INC	B	Return with this 'paper colour
		RET	Z	code' if the CAPS SHIFT is
				not being used.
		ADD	A,+08	But if it is then the range is to
		RET		be +18 to +1F instead - indicat-
				ing an 'ink colour code'.

The digit keys '8' and '9' are to give 'BRIGHT' & 'FLASH' codes.

0382	K-8-&-9	SUB	+36	+38 & +39 go to +02 & +03.
		INC	B	Return with these codes if CAPS
		RET	Z	SHIFT is not being used. (These
				are 'BRIGHT' codes.)
		ADD	A,+FE	Subtract '2' is CAPS SHIFT is
		RET		being used; giving +00 & +01 (as
				'FLASH' codes).

The digit keys in graphics mode are to give the block graphic characters (+80 to +8F), the GRAPHICS code (+0F) and the DELETE code (+0C).

0389	K-GRA-DGT	LD	HL,+0230	The base address of table 'd'.
		CP	+39	Use this table directly for
		JR	Z,034A,K-LOOK-UP	both digit key '9' that is to give
		CP	+30	GRAPHICS, and digit key '0'
		JR	Z,034A,K-LOOK-UP	that is to give DELETE.
		AND	+07	For keys '1' to '8' make the
		ADD	A,+80	range +80 to +87.
		INC	B	Return with a value from this
		RET	Z	range if neither shift key is
				being pressed.
		XR	+0F	But if 'shifted' make the range
		RET		+88 to +8F.

Finally consider the digit keys in 'K', 'L' & 'C' modes.

039D	K-KLC-DGT	INC	B	Return directly if neither shift
		RET	Z	key is being used. (Final codes
				+30 to +39.)
		BIT	5,B	Use table 'd' if the CAPS
		LD	HL,+0230	SHIFT key is also being
		JR	NZ,034A,K-LOOK-UP	pressed.
