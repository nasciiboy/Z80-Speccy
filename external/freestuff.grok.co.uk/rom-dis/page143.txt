		EX	DE,HL	Switch the two pointers.
		POP	BC	Get B & C back.
		JR	2900,V-EACH	Go around the loop again.

Come here if no entry was found with the correct name.

2932	V-80-BYTE	SET	7,B	Signal 'variable not found'.

Come here if checking syntax.

2934	V-SYNTAX	POP	DE	Drop the pointer to the
				2nd. character.
		RST	0018,GET-CHAR	Fetch the present character.
		CP	+28	Is it a '('?
		JR	Z,2943,V-PASS	Jump forward.
		SET	5,B	Indicate not dealing with an
		JR	294B,V-END	array and jump forward.

Come here when an entry with the correct name was found.

293E	V-FOUND-1	POP	DE	Drop the saved variable pointer.
293F	V-FOUND2	POP	DE	Drop the 2nd character pointer.
		POP	DE	Drop the first letter pointer.
		PUSH	HL	Save the 'last' letter pointer.
		RST	0018,GET-CHAR	Fetch the current character.

If the matching variable name has more than a single letter then the other characters must be passed-over.

Note: This appears to have been done already at V-CHAR.

2943	V-PASS	CALL	2C88,ALPHANUM	Is it alphanumeric?
		JR	NC,294B,V-END	Jump when the end of the name
				has been found.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Fetch the next character.
		JR	2943,V-PASS	Go back and test it.

The exit-parameters are now set.

294B	V-END	POP	HL	HL holds the pointer to the
				letter of a short name or the
				'last' character of a long name.
		RL	B	Rotate the whole register.
		BIT	6,B	Specify the state of bit 6.
		RET		Finished.

The exit-parameters for the subroutine can be summarised as follows: The system variable CH-ADD points to the first location after the name of the variable as it occurs in the BASIC line.

When 'variable not found':

i. The carry flag is set.

ii. The zero flag is set only when the search was for an array variable.

iii. The HL register pair points to the first letter of the name of the variable as it occurs in the BASIC line.

When 'variable found':

i. The carry flag is reset.

ii. The zero flag is set for both simple string variables and all array variables.

iii. The HL register pair points to the letter of a 'short' name, or the last character of a 'long' name, of the existing entry that was found in the variables area.

In all cases bits 5 & 6 of the C register indicate the type of variable being handled. Bit 7 is the complement of the SYNTAX/RUN flag. But only when the subroutine is used in 'runtime' will bits 0 to 4 hold the code of the variable's letter.

In syntax time the return is always made with the carry flag reset. The zero flag is set for arrays and reset for all other variables, except that a simple string name incorrectly followed by a '$' sets the zero flag and, in the case of SAVE "name" DATA a$(), passes syntax as well.
