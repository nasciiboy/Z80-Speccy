<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a project to create an electronic (text)

Dr.Frank O'Hara, published by Melbourne House (Publishers) Ltd in 1983. It stems

comp.sys.sinclair</a>, and from the work of Mark Street who has produced an 
image-based <a href="http://www.faime.demon.co.uk/download">PDF of the book</a>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The book is long out of print, and it's my 
understanding that the copyright is currently owned by the authors 
but, to date, I have not been able to contact them to ask for permission to 
distribute it.</font></p>

you know where either of them can be reached, then please email me at

absence of any information to the contrary, I am taking the slightly-dubious 
stance of assuming that it's okay to continue with the project to make this book 
available in electronic form.</font></p>
