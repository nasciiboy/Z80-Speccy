The commands of class-00 must not have any operands. e.g. COPY & CONTINUE.

1C10	CLASS-00	CP	A	Set the zero flag for later.

The commands of class-05 may be followed by a set of items. e.g. PRINT & PRINT "222".

1C11	CLASS-05	POP	BC	In all cases drop the address
				- SCAN-LOOP.
		CALL	Z,1BEE,CHECK-END	If handling commands of classes
				00 & 03 AND syntax is being
				checked move on now to
				consider the next statement.
		EX	DE,HL	Save the line pointer in the DE
				register pair.

THE 'JUMP-C-R' ROUTINE
After the command class entries and the separator entries in the parameter table have been considered the jump to the appropriate command routine is made.

1C16	JUMP-C-R	LD	HL,(T-ADDR)	Fetch the pointer to the
		LD	C,(HL)	entries in the parameter table
		INC	HL	and fetch the address of the
		LD	B,(HL)	required command routine.
		EX	DE,HL	Exchange the pointers back
		PUSH	BC	and make an indirect jump
		RET		to the command routine.

THE 'COMMAND CLASSES - 01, 02 & 04'
These three command classes are used by the variable handling commands - LET, FOR & NEXT and indirectly by READ & INPUT.
	Command class 01 is concerned with the identification of the variable in a LET, READ or INPUT statement.

1C1F	CLASS-01	CALL	28B2,LOOK-VARS	Look in the variables area to
				determine whether or not
				the variable has been used already.

THE 'VARIABLE IN ASSIGNMENT' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine develops the appropriate values for the system variables DEST & STRLEN.

1C22	VAR-A-1	LD	(FLAGX),+00	Initialise FLAGX to +00.
		JR	NC,1C30,VAR-A-2	Jump forward if the variable
				has been used before.
		SET	1,(FLAGX)	Signal 'a new variable'.
		JR	NZ,1C46,VAR-A-3	Give an error if trying to use
				an 'undimensioned array'.

Report 2 - Variable not found

1C2E	REPORT-2	RST	0008,ERROR-1	Call the error handling
		DEFB	+01	routine.

Continue with the handling of existing variables.

1C30	VAR-A-2	CALL	Z,2996,STK-VARS	The parameters of simple string
				variables and all array variables
				are passed to the calculator
				stack. (STK-VARS will 'slice' a
				string if required.)
		BIT	6,(FLAGS)	Jump forward if handling a
		JR	NZ,1C46,VAR-A-3	numeric variable.
		XOR	A	Clear the A register.
		CALL	2530,SYNTAX-Z	The parameters of the string of
		CALL	NZ,2BF1,STK-FETCH	string array variable are fetched
				unless syntax is being checked.
		LD	HL,+5C71	This is FLAGX.
