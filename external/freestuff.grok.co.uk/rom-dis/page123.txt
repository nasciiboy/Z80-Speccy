THE 'INITIAL PARAMETERS' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine is called by both CIRCLE and DRAW to set their initial parameters. It is called by CIRCLE with X, Y and the radius Z on the top of the stack, reading upwards. It is called by DRAW with its own X, Y, SIN (G/2) and Z, as defined in DRAW i. above, on the top of the stack. In what follows the stack is only shown from Z upwards.
The subroutine returns in B the arc-count A as explained in both CIRCLE and DRAW above, and in mem-0 to mem-5 the quantities G/A, SIN (G/2*A), 0, COS (G/A), SIN (G/A) and G. For a circle, G must be taken to be equal to 2*PI.
