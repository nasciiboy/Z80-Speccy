THE 'SCANNING FUNCTION' SUBROUTINE

This subroutine is called by the 'scanning FN routine' to evaluate a user defined function which occurs in a BASIC line. The subroutine can be considered in four stages:

i. The syntax of the FN statement is checked during syntax checking.

ii. During line execution, a search is made of the program area for a DEF FN statement, and the names of the functions are compated, until a match is found - or an error is reported.

iii. The arguments of the FN are evaluated by calls to SCANNING.

iv. The function itself is evaluated by calling SCANNING, which in turn calls LOOK-VARS and so the 'STACK FUNCTION ARGUMENT' subroutine.

278D	S-FN-SBRN	CALL	2530,SYNTAX-Z	Unless syntax is being checked,
		JR	NZ,27F7,SF-RUN	a jump is made to SF-RUN.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the first character of the
				name.
		CALL	2C8D,ALPHA	If it is not alphabetic, then
		JP	NC,1C8A,REPORT-C	report the error.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the next character.
		CP	+24	Is it a '$'?
		PUSH	AF	Save the zero flag on the stack.
		JR	NZ,27D0,SF-BRKT-1	Jump if it was not a '$'.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	But get the next character if it
				was.
2700	SF-BRKT-1	CP	+28	If the character is not a '(', then
		JR	NZ,27E6,SF-RPRT-C	report the error.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the next character.
		CP	+29	Is it a ')'?
		JR	Z,27E9,SF-FLAG-6	Jump if it is; there are no argu-
				ments.
27D9	SF-ARGMTS	CALL	24FB,SCANNING	Within the loop, call SCANNING
				to check the syntax of each
				argument and to insert floating-
				point numbers.
		RST	0018,GET-CHAR	Get the character which follows
		CP	+2C	the argument; if it is not a ','
		JR	NZ,27E4,SF-BRKT-2	then jump - no more arguments.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the first character in the
				next argument.
