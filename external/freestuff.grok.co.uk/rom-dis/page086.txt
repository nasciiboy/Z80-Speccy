Note: The requirements for the different command classes are as follows:

CLASS-00	-	No further operands.
CLASS-01	-	Used in LET. A variable is required.
CLASS-02	-	Used in LET. An expression, numeric or string, must follow.
CLASS-03	-	A numeric expression may follow. Zero to be used in case of default.
CLASS-04	-	A single character variable must follow.
CLASS-05	-	A set of items may be given.
CLASS-06	-	A numeric expression must follow.
CLASS-07	-	Handles colour items.
CLASS-08	-	Two numeric expressions, separated by a comma, must follow.
CLASS-09	-	As for CLASS-08 but colour items may precede the expressions.
CLASS-0A	-	A string expression must follow.
CLASS-OB	-	Handles cassette routines.


THE 'MAIN PARSER' OF THE BASIC INTERPRETER
The parsing routine of the BASIC interpreter is entered at LINE-SCAN when syntax is being checked, and at LINE-RUN when a BASIC program of one or more statements is to be executed.

Each statement is considered in turn and the system variable CH-ADD is used to point to each code of the statement as it occurs in the program area or the editing area.

1B17	LINE-SCAN	RES	7,(FLAGS)	Signal 'syntax checking'.
		CALL	19FB,E-LINE-NO	CH-ADD is made to point to the
				first code after any line number.
		XOR	A	The system variable SUBPPC
		LD	(SUBPPC),A	is initialised to +00 and
		DEC	A	ERR-NR to +FF.
		LD	(ERR-NR),A
		JR	1B29,STMT-L-1	Jump forward to consider the
				first statement of the line.
