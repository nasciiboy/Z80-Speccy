		LD	A,B	Fetch the low-byte and test
				it further.
		ADD	A,+3C
		JP	P,0425,BE-i-OK	Accept -60<=i<=67.
		JP	PO,046C,REPORT-B	Reject -128 to -61.

Note: The range +70 to +127 will be rejected later on.

The correct frequency for the 'pitch' i can now be found.

0425	BE-i-OK	LD	B,+FA	Start '6' octaves below middle C.
0427	BE-OCTAVE	INC	B	Repeatedly reduce i in order to
		SUB	+0C	find the correct octave.
		JR	NC,0427,BE-OCTAVE
		ADD	A,+0C	Ass back the last subtraction.
		PUSH	BC	Save the octave number.
		LD	HL,+046E	The base address of the 'semi-
				tone table'.
		CALL	3406,LOC-MEM	Consider the table and pass the
		CALL	33B4,STACK-NUM	'A th.' value to the calculator
				stack. (Call it C.)

Now the fractional part of the 'pitch' can be taken into consideration.

		DEFB	+04,multiply	t, C(pK+1)
		DEFB	+38,end-calc

The final frequency f is found by modifying the 'last value' according to the octave number.

		POP	AF	Fetch the octave number.
		ADD	A,(HL)	Multiply the 'last value' by
		LD	(HL),A	'2 to the power of the octave
				number'.
		RST	0028,FP-CALC	t, f
		DEFB	+C0,st-mem-0	The frequency is put aside for
		DEFB	+02,delete	the moment in mem-0.

Attention is now turned to the 'duration'.
		DEFB	+31,duplicate	t, t
		DEFB	+38,end-calc
		CALL	1E94,FIND-INT1	The value 'INT t' must be in
		CP	+0B	the range +00 to +0A.

The number of complete cycles in the 'beep' is given by 'f*t' so this value is now found.

		RST	0028,FP-CALC	t
		DEFB	+E0,get-mem-0	t, f
		DEFB	+04,multiply	f*t

The result is left on the calculator stack whilst the length of the 'timing loop' required for the 'beep' is computed;

		DEFB	+E0,get-mem-0	f*t
		DEFB	+34,stk-data	The value '3.5 * 10^6/8'
		DEFB	+80,four bytes	is formed on the top of
