				and hence the existing entry is
				not to be reclaimed.

There are three possible forms of the last subscript. The first is illustrated by - A$(2,4 TO 8) -, the second by - A$(2)(4 TO 8) - and the third by - A$(2) - which is the default form and indicates that the whole string is required.

		RST 	0018,GET-CHAR 	Get the present character.
		CP 	+29 	Is it a ')'?
		JR 	Z,2A48,SV-DIM 	Jump if it is so.
		CP 	+2C 	Is it a ','?
		JR 	NZ,2A20,REPORT-3 	Report the error if not so.
2A45 	SV-SLICE 	CALL 	2A52,SLlCING 	Use SLICING to modify the
				set of parameters.
2A48 	SV-DIM 	RST 	0020,NEXT-CHAR 	Fetch the next character.
2A49 	SV-SLlCE? 	CP 	+28 	Is It a '('?
		JR 	Z,2A45,SV-SLICE 	Jump back if there is a
				'slice' to be considered.

When finished considering the last subscript a return can be made.
		RES 	6,(FLAGS) 	Signal - string result.
		RET 		Return with the parameters of
				the required string forming a
				'last value' on the calculator
				stack.

THE 'SLICING' SUBROUTINE
The present string can be sliced using this subroutine. The subroutine is entered with the parameters of the string being present on the top of the calculator stack and in the registers A, B, C, D & E. Initially the SYNTAX/RUN flag is tested and the parameters of the string are fetched only if a line is being executed.

2A52 	SLICING 	CALL 	2530,SYNTAX-Z 	Check the flag.
		CALL 	NZ,2BF1,STK-FETCH 	Take the parameters off the
				stack in 'run-time'.

The possibility of the 'slice' being '()' has to be considered.
		RST 	0020,NEXT-CHAR 	Get the next character.
		CP 	+29 	Is it a ')'?
		JR 	Z,2AAD,SL-STORE 	Jump forward if it is so.

Before proceeding the registers are manipulated as follows:

		PUSH 	DE 	The 'start' goes on the
				machine stack.
		XOR 	A 	The A register is cleared
		PUSH 	AF 	and saved.
		PUSH 	BC 	The 'length' is saved briefly.
		LD 	DE,+0001 	Presume that the 'slice' is to
				begin with the first character.
		RST 	0018,GET -CHAR 	Get the first character.
		POP 	HL 	Pass the 'length' to HL.

The first parameter of the 'slice' is now evaluated.

		CP 	+CC 	Is the present character a
				'TO'?
		JR 	Z,2A81,SL-SECOND 	The first parameter, by default,
				will be '1' if the jump is taken.
		POP 	AF 	At this stage A is zero.
		CALL 	2ACD,INT-EXP2 	BC is made to hold the first
				parameter. A will hold +FF if
				there has been an 'out of range'
				error.
		PUSH 	AF 	Save the value anyway.
		LD 	D,B 	Transfer the first parameter
		LD 	E,C 	to DE.
		PUSH 	HL 	Save the 'length' briefly.
