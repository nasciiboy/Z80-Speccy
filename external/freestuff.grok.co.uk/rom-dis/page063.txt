		LD	C,(SUBPPC)	Fetch the current statement
		LD	B,+00	number into the BC register
		CALL	1A1B,OUT-NUM1	pair and print it.
		CALL	1097,CLEAR-SP	Clear the editing area.
		LD	A,(ERR-NR)	Fetch the error number again.
		INC	A	Increment it as usual.
		JR	Z,1386,MAIN-9	If the program was completed
				successfully there cannot be
				any 'CONTinuing' so jump.
		CP	+09	If the program halted with
		JR	Z,1373,MAIN-6	'STOP statement' or 'BREAK
		CP	+15	into program' CONTinuing will
		JR	NZ,1376,MAIN-7	be from the next statement;
1373	MAIN-6	INC	(SUBPPC)	otherwise SUBPPC is unchanged.
1376	MAIN-7	LD	BC,+0003	The system variables OLDPPC
		LD	DE,+5C70	& OSPCC have now to be made
				to hold the CONTinuing line
				and statement numbers.
		LD	HL,+5C44	The values used will be those in
		BIT	7,(NSPPC)	PPC & SUBPPC unless NSPPC
		JR	Z,1384,MAIN-8	indicates that the 'break'
		ADD	HL,BC	occurred before a 'jump'.
1384	MAIN-8	LDDR		(i.e. after a GO TO statement
				etc.)
1386	MAIN-9	LD	(NSPPC),+FF	NSPPC is reset to indicate
				'no jump'.
		RES	3,(FLAGS)	'K mode' is selected.
		JP	12AC,MAIN-2	And finally the jump back is
				made but no program listing
				will appear until requested.
