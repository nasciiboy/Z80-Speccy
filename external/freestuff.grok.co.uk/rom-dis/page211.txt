THE 'INT' FUNCTION
(Offset 27: 'int')

This subroutine handles the function INT X and returns a 'last value' that is the 'integer part' of the value supplied. Thus INT 2.4 gives 2 but as the subroutine always rounds the result down INT -2.4 gives -3.
The subroutine uses the INTEGER TRUNCATION TOWARDS ZERO subroutine at 3214 to produce I (X) such that I (2.4) gives 2 and I (-2.4) gives -2. Thus, INT X is gives by I (X) for values of X that are greater than or equal to zero, and I (X)-1 for negative values of X that are not already integers, when the result is, of course, I (X).

THE 'EXPONENTIAL' FUNCTION
(Offset 26: 'exp')

This subroutine handles the function EXP X and is the first of four routines that use SERIES GENERATOR to produce Chebyshev polynomials.
The approximation to EXP X is found as follows:

i. X is divided by LN 2 to give Y, so that 2 to the power Y is now the required result.

ii. The value N is found, such that N=INT Y.

iii. The value W is found, such that W=Y-N, where 0 <=W <=1, as required for the series to converge.
