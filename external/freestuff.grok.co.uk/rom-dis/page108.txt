A loop is now set up to deal with each character in turn of the string.
203C	PR-STRING	LD	A,B	Return now if there are
		OR	C	no characters remaining
		DEC	BC	in the string; otherwise
		RET	Z	decease the counter.
		LD	A,(DE)	Fetch the code and increment
		INC	DE	the pointer.
		RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	The code is printed and a jump
		JR	203C,PR-STRING	taken to consider any further
				characters.

THE 'END OF PRINTING' SUBROUTINE
The zero flag will be set if no further printing is to be done.
2045	PR-END-Z	CP	+29	Return now if the character
		RET	Z	is a ')'.
2048	PR-ST-END	CP	+0D	Return now if the character is
		RET	Z	a 'carriage return'.
		CP	+3A	Make a final test against ':'
		RET		before returning.

THE 'PRINT POSITION' SUBROUTINE
The various position controlling characters are considered by this subroutine.
204E	PR-POSN-1	RST	0018,GET-CHAR	Get the present character.
		CP	+3B	Jump forward if it is
		JR	Z,2067,PR-POSN-3	a ';'.
		CP	+2C	Also jump forward with a
		JR	NZ,2061,PR-POSN-2	character other than a ',';
		CALL	2530,SYNTAX-Z	but do not actually print the
		JR	Z,2067,PR-POSN-3	character if checking syntax.
		LD	A,+06	Load the A register with
		RST	0010,PRINT-A-1	the 'comma' control code and
		JR	2067,PR-POSN-3	print it; then jump forward.
2061	PR-POSN-2	CP	+27	Is it a '''?
		RET	NZ	Return now if not any of the
				position controllers.
		CALL	1FF5,PR-CR	Print 'carriage return' unless
				checking syntax.
2067	PR-POSN-3	RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Fetch the next character.
		CALL	2045,PR-END-Z	If not at the end of a print
		JR	NZ,206E,PR-POSN-4	statement then jump forward;
		POP	BC	otherwise return to the
206E	PR-POSN-4	CP	A	calling routine.
		RET		The zero flag will be reset if the
				end of the print statement has
				not been reached.

THE 'ALTER STREAM' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine is called whenever there is the need to consider whether the user wishes to use a different stream.
2070	STR-ALTER	CP	+23	Unless the present character
		SCF		is a '#' return with the
		RET	NZ	carry flag set.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Advance CH-ADD.
		CALL	1C82,EXPT-1NUM	Pass the parameter to the
				calculator stack.
		AND	A	Clear the carry flag.
		CALL	1FC3,UNSTACK-Z	Return now if checking syntax.
		CALL	1E94,FIND-INT1	The value is passed to the A
				register.
		CP	+10	Give report O if the value is
