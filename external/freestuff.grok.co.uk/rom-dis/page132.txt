		CALL	031E,K-TEST	Test the key value; stack empty
		JR	NC,2660,S-IK$-STK	string if unsatisfactory.
		DEC	D	+FF to D for L made (bit 3 set).
		LD	E,A	Key-value to E for decoding.
		CALL	0333,K-DECODE	Decode the key-value.

		LD	(DE),A	Prepare to stack it as a string.
		LD	C,+01	Its length is one.
2660	S-IK$-STK	LD	B,+00	Complete the length parameter.
		CALL	2AB2,STK-STO-$	Stack the required string.
2665	S-INK$-EN	JP	2712,S-CONT-2	Jump forward.

				given.
		CALL	NZ,2580,S-ATTR-S	Call the subroutine unless

The 'scanning DECIMAL routine' which follows deals with a decimal point or a number that starts with a digit. It also takes care of the expression 'BIN', which is dealt with in the 'decimal to floating-point' subroutine.

268D	S-DECIMAL	CALL	2530,SYNTAX-Z	Jump forward if a line is
	(EQU. S-BIN)	JR	NZ,2685,S-STK-DEC	being executed.

The action taken is now very different for syntax checking and line execution. If syntax is being checked then the floating-point form has to be calculated and copied into the actual BASIC line. However when a line is being executed the floating-point form will always be available so it is copied to the calculator stack to form a 'last value'.

During syntax checking:
		CALL	2C9B,DEC-TO-FP	The floating-point form is
				found.
		RST	0018,GET-CHAR	Set HL to point one past the
				last digit.
		LD	BC,+0006	Six locations are required.
		CALL	1655,MAKE-ROOM	Make the room in the BASIC
				line.
		INC	HL	Point to the first free space.
		LD	(HL),+0E	Enter the number marker code.
		INC	HL	Point to the second location.
		EX	DE,HL	This pointer is wanted in DE.
