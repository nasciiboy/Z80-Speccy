27E9	SF-FLAG-6	RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Point to the next character in
				the BASIC line.
		LD	HL.+5C3B	This is FLAGS; assume a string-

ii. During line execution, a search must first be made for a DEF FN statement.

27F7	SF-RUN	RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the first character of the
				name.
		AND	+DF	Reset bit 5 for upper case.
		LD	B,A	Copy the name to B.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the next character.
		SUB	+24	Subtract 24 hex, the code for '$'.
		LD	C,A	Copy the result to C (zero for a
				string, non-zero for a numerical
				function).
		JR	NZ,2802.SF-ARGMT1 Jump if non-zero: numerical
				function.
		RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get the next character, the '('.
2802	SF-ARGMT1	RST	0020,NEXT-CHAR	Get 1st character of 1st argu-

When a DEF FN statement is found, the name and status of the two functions are compared: if they do not match, the search is resumed.

2814	SF-CP-DEF	PUSH	HL	Save the pointer to the DEF FN
				character in case the search has
				to be resumed.
		CALL	28AB,FN-SKPOVR	Get the name of the DEF FN
