<A HREF="mailto:mark.woodmass@nospam.ntlworld.com">Mark Woodmass</A> has
provided some performance-related enhancements and has also supplied an improved
routine for decoding port addresses (this basically means that vbSpec
v1.60 is more accurate and will work with more obscure and unusual demos and
games!).
He also assisted me in tracking down a problem
with loading certain TZX files and generally supplies help and moral
support by putting up with my long, rambling e-mails!</FONT></P>

information is now available for other emulator authors in the

also beta-tested the TC2048 support and provided various pieces of test code
that allowed me to get the TC2048 hi-res/hi-colour display modes working
properly. Andrew has also produced <A HREF="../files/2048dmo1.zip">this slideshow

numerous other people who have contributed ideas and source code for vbSpec. I
had no idea that the project would become as popular as it has, and I wasn't
expecting the volume of contributions that I've received! I may need to set up
a CVS tree for vbSpec in the near future as I currently have conflicting code
for a large number of new features. Working through these patches and additing
them to my primary copy of the source will take some time. However here are
some brief details of what I have yet to add:-</FONT></P>

adding the sound support to vbSpec 1.20. Not only did he do the majority of the
groundwork and research required to emulate the 48K Spectrum's beeper, he also
provided code for emulating the AY-3-8912 three channel sound of the 128K
Spectrum models. It was quite an experience for me to hear vbSpec producing
full 3 channel sound and effects for the first time -- he's done an excellent
job I think!</FONT></P>

included replacing floating point division with integer division throughout the
Z80 emulation, replacing Iif() functions with block If's, and replacing various
occurences of integer and byte variables with longs. He also made various
helpful suggestions about improving the efficiency of the native VB display
routines. The end result is a version of vbSpec that runs around 2-3 times
faster than the previous release!</FONT></P>
