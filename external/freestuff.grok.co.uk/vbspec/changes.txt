vbSpec 1.7  -- 28th January 2003
================================
1. vbSpec can now write TAP files as well as reading them.
2. New "Save Binary..." menu option to save any area of addressable
   memory as a raw binary file (potentially useful for debugging and
   disassembling games).
3. Now supports "Amiga 2- Button Mouse in Kempston Joystick port".
   This method of adding mouse support to a spectrum is very popular
   within the Russian demo scene.
4. The "Kempston Mouse Interface" support had transposed left and
   right mouse buttons. Now fixed.
5. Some optimisation. Including a faster DAA routine (let's see if
   anyone ever notices!).
6. Fixed a nasty bug that sometimes caused invalid Z80 snapshots to
   be saved.

vbSpec 1.62 -- 2nd December 2002
=================================
1. Fixed tape sound during TZX playback.
2. Inlined some more functions in the Z80 core to improve performance:
   GetAF, GetBC, GetH, GetL, inc16, qdec8, etc.
3. Window positions (Main Window, ZX Printer Window, Tape Controls
   Window) are now saved/restored each time vbSpec is run.

vbSpec 1.61 -- 28th November 2002
=================================
1. Fixed the annoying "clicking/popping" noises that used to occur
   at various points when using vbSpec (thanks to Simon Owen and
   Simon Haynes for their assistance with this).
2. Fixed the .z80 file compression routine, which sometimes
   produced invalid .z80 files (thanks to Mark Woodmass for
   his assistance).
3. Port #FF in TC2048 mode is now decoded correctly (thanks to
   Andrew Owen and Frederick Meunier for their help).
4. Added some additional sanity checking when loading .z80 files.
5. Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the "Use SE Basic ROM"
   checkbox to be greyed out when it shouldn't be.
6. Optimised the sound routines a little to get rid of latency and
   improve performance.

vbSpec 1.60 -- 26th Novemeber 2002
==================================
1. Some fixes to the TZX support for DRB-format TZX blocks.
2. Added emulation of the Sinclair ZX Printer/Alphacom 32 printer.
3. Added emulation of the Kempston Mouse Interface.
4. Added "Most Recently Used" file list support.
5. Added command line snapshot/tape/rom loading support.
6. Optimized the pokeb subroutines (submitted by Mark Woodmass).
7. Optimized many of the Z80 opcode subroutines (submitted by
   Gonchuki).
8. Added inline versions of some functions (such as PUSH PC and POP
   PC) to "help" the VB optimizer (submitted by Gonchuki).
9. The hDC property of the Spectrum display window is now stored as
   a 32-bit long rather than being re-read during each display update.
   (submitted by Gonchuki).
10.Now creates and reads TC2048 .z80 snapshots that are compatible
   with FUSE (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator).
11.Some changes to the user interface (vbSpec is now dependent upon
   the Microsoft Windows Common Controls OCX - MSCOMCTL.OCX)
12.Performed various miscellaneous minor bug fixes.
   
vbSpec 1.50 -- 25th August 2002
===============================
1. Added support for loading TZX files, as submitted by Mark Woodmass.
2. Added a simple TZX tape interface.
3. Fixed a very minor bug in the LDIR/LDDR support (the undocumented
   flag bits 3 and 5 where not updated properly by these opcodes).
4. Fixed a minor bug in the CALL xx,nn opcodes (return address was 
   being pushed onto the stack after the CALL was actioned, which
   caused problems in some obscure self-modifying code). Bug identified
   and fixed by Mark Woodmass.
5. Improved the accuracy of the TC2048 keyboard emulation (the TC2048's
   compatibility problems with games such as Uridium are now correctly
   emulated!). Thanks to Fredrick Meunier for the description of the
   TC2048 keyboard port.

vbSpec 1.40 -- 29th February 2002
=================================
1. Added scanline-accurate display rendering, so that games and demos that
   use tricks to display multi-colour graphics now look right.
2. Added emulation of contended memory. Memory between $4000 and $7FFF is
   shared between the ULA (which updates the video display) and the CPU,
   and any code or data in this area of memory can sometimes be accessed
   more slowly than the rest of RAM.
3. Added support for saving screenshots in Windows .BMP format and Spectrum
   .SCR format.
4. Added support for loading .SCR screenshots. vbSpec will also open Timex
   hi-resolution and hi-colour screen images, and is capable of converting
   standard Spectrum .SCR files to the Timex hi-colour format.
5. Some more minor performance optimizations.
6. Fixed some undocumented opcode timings. Some of the DD/FD opcodes were
   erroneously set-up to take 9 tstates rather than 8.

vbSpec 1.30 -- 1st February 2002
================================
1. Added support for the TC2048 colour computer. Thanks to Andrew Owen for
   providing technical information, test code, beta-testing and
   encouragement!
2. Speeded-up the Z80 emulation by using labels and gotos (yeuch!) in place
   of the huge 'select case' statements. There are now only 8 compares per
   instruction fetch rather than up to 256 that we required by the old
   code. This has improved performance considerably. Thanks to Bob Woodring
   for the idea.
3. Added support for loading .TAP files (open a .tap file, then type
   LOAD "" to load it, as you would on a real Spectrum).
4. Added support for Windows drag and drop. You can down drag .sna, .z80,
   .tap or .rom files from any drag&drop capable Windows program onto vbSpec.
5. Fixed some minor bugs in the Z80 emulation (timing issues related to 
   undocumented opcodes).
6. Many optimisations and improvements to the Z80 emulation and the display
   code.
  

vbSpec 1.20 -- 15th May 2000
============================
Many new features (thanks to James Bagg for implementing AY-3-8912 sound):-

1. Added support for emulation of the 48K Spectrum's beeper (uses waveOut*
   Windows API functions, so requires vbSpec to be compiled with USE_WINAPI
   defined).
2. Added support for emulation of the Spectrum 128 and Spectrum +2.
3. Added support for emulation of the 128/+2 sound chip (AY-3-8912), as with
   the beeper sound, this requires USE_WINAPI to be defined when compiling.
4. Speed imrovements to the WINAPI display rountine -- the display now blits
   the smallest possible rectangular area of the display that encompasses all
   of the changes between frames. The addition of the sound and 128K support
   has slowed things down a little down -- you'll need a 266MHz PII with a
   reasonably good display card to run the emulator at full speed.
5. Improved the code that controls the speed of emulation -- this helps to
   ensure that the sound is reproduced properly, as well as ensuring that 
   games run more smoothly.
6. Added the ability to load 128K .Z80 and .SNA snapshots.
7. Added the ability to save snapshots (both 48K and 128K snapshots can be
   saved in either .SNA or .Z80 format).
8. Added the ability to save ROM images. This causes the bottom 16KB of
   the currently paged-in memory to be saved as a raw binary image.
9. The 'R' register was not being properly initialised when loading certain
   snapshots -- this caused problems with a few games. Now fixed.

vbSpec 1.10 -- 18th April 2000
==============================
Some new features, and a massive performance increase:-

1. Added USE_WINAPI conditional compiler directive. If defined, a version of
   vbSpec that uses Windows API functions to increase speed and functionality
   will be compiled. Leaving USE_WINAPI undefined produces a 100% native VB
   build that is slower and slightly less functional.
2. Added a new WINAPI display routine that uses the StrechDIBits() API to
   produce a fast, buffered display which can be scaled to various sizes using
   a new "Display options..." dialog.
3. Improved the performance of the native VB display routines by using a
   lookup table that maps X+Y screen coorindates to a Spectrum memory location.
   Various other performance improvements to the VB display code have also
   been added.
4. Improved the performance of the VB display routines by using a lookup table
   containing RGB values for the 15 Spectrum colours.
5. Greatly improved the speed of the Z80 emulation by getting rid of all of the
   floating point division and Int() calls and replacing them with integer
   division (example: "Int(X / 256&)" becomes "(X \ 256&)".
6. Greatly improved the speed of the Z80 emulation and screen updating by
   replacing all Integer and Byte variables with Longs.
7. Replaced all occurences of Iif() with block If statements for a further 
   performance increase.
8. Added the ability to customise the emulation speed via a new "Options..."
   dialog.
9. Modified the keyboard routine to support numeric keypad, backspace, ';',
   and various other keys.
10.Fixed some bugs in the Z80 emulation. For example: RL (IX+d) and RL (IY+d).
11.Added support for some additional undocumented Z80 opcodes:-
   LD B,RES 0,(IX+d) and various similar DDCB and FDCB instructions.
12.Fixed broken implementation of the 'R' register.

vbSpec 1.00 -- 8th February 2000
================================
Initial public release
