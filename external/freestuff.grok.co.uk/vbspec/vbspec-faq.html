<P><B>Q1. What is vbSpec?</B><BR>
vbSpec is a program that runs on Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000 or Windows
XP, and emulates a Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer (both 48K and 128K models are
emulated, as is the Timex Colour TC2048). The ZX Spectrum is a simple,
beautifully-designed little computer based around a Zilog Z80A CPU running at
3.5MHz. It was hugely popular in the 1980's, and has a strong and dedicated
following to this day. Very unusually for an emulator, vbSpec is written
entirely in Visual Basic.</P>
<P><B>Q2. Why on earth would anyone want to write an emulator in Visual
Basic?</B><BR>
There are lots of reasons why you <I>wouldn't</I> want to write an emulator in
VB - the lack of any bitwise rotation operators means that relatively expensive
(in terms of CPU time) integer division and multiplication has to be used
instead of simple bit-shifts, there's no unsigned 16-bit integer type in VB
which is inconvenient when it comes to emulating a Z80, VB is not very
portable, and perhaps most importantly of all:- even compiled, optimised VB
code calls DLL routines for many BASIC statements and functions as they are
executed. The overhead of all of these DLL function calls, coupled with various
other things such as intense parameter checking, means that code written in VB
executes quite <B>slowly</B> when compared to equivalent algorithms written and
compiled with, say, Visual C++ or Borland Delphi. So, to actually get on and
answer the question &quot;<B>Why VB?</B>&quot;, the three simple reasons are:- 
</P>
<OL>
<LI> To be different (there's loads of publicly available Z80 emulation code
written in C, C++, Assembler for various processors, and Delphi, but nothing
else, to my knowledge, written in VB!)</LI>
<LI> To see how fast it would run (and indeed, to see if it would run at all!) 
</LI>
<LI>As a learning tool (this was certainly a great learning exercise for me,
and hopefully the source will be of interest to the proliferation of VB
programmers in the world, some of whom may not know any other programming
language).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Although this project was originally intended simply as an exercise in
seeing what was possible with VB, it has gradually become quite a well-featured
emulator in it's own right. This is quite embarrassing to me, as I really would
have written it in C or Delphi if I'd have realised people were actually going
to use it!</P>
<P><B>Q3. How fast is it?</B><BR>
Version 1.40, with its support for Spectrum 128K memory paging and full sound
emulation (beeper and AY-3-8912) and the additional Timex video modes, manages
full 3.5MHz Spectrum speed on a 266MHz Pentium-MMX when used with a fairly fast
display card. </P>
<P>As of version 1.40, I have removed the &quot;USE_WINAPI&quot; compiler
directive as it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain source code for
producing a 100% native VB version (in other words, a version that does not
explicitly call any Windows API functions itself). With the new features that
have recently been added, I've decided it's okay just to go ahead and include
WinAPI function calls in the code although I would discourage this in
situations where it is possible to use native VB code without any performance
degradation. I guess this reflects that fact that vbSpec is increasingly being
used as a &quot;serious&quot; emulator rather than the programmer's folly it
was originally intended to be.</P>
<P><B>Q4. What features does it have?</B><BR>
The Z80 emulation supports all of the undocumented opcodes that are in common
use, and bits 3 and 5 of the Flags register are correctly emulated (the rhino
in Ultimate's &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; walks around properly!). The colour
display is fully emulated, including bright and flashing attributes, and as of
v1.40 the display is painted on a scanline-basis so programs which use subtle
tricks to display more than two colours per attribute square should look right.
There is full sound emulation, using the Windows waveOut* API functions to
emulate both the 48K Spectrum's beeper and the 3 channel sound of the 128K
Spectrum models. Support for loading and saving of .Z80 and .SNA snapshot
images is included, and .TAP tape images and raw 16K ROM images can also be
loaded (no patches are made to the ROM by vbSpec, so any image that would work
with a real Spectrum should work with vbSpec too).</P>
<P><B>Q5. Can anything be done to make it run faster?</B><BR>
I've done as much optimization as I can, but I don't doubt that there is some
room for further improvement. When I released vbSpec v1.00, a number of people
sent in suggestions for optimizing various parts of the code (most notably
Miguel Santos, whose suggestions resulted in 2- to 3-fold increase in the
overall performance of vbSpec!). A lot of these initial optimizations have been
gradually eaten up by the additional overhead of the new features such as 128K
paged memory, AY-3-8912 sound, scanline display code, so if anyone has any
suggestions for further improving the performance without resorting to using
external libraries, I'd be very pleased to hear about them!</P>
<P><B>Q6. I think I found a bug! Are you interested?</B><BR>
Yes, most definitely. If you find a bug, please e-mail the details to me at
&lt;ccowley@grok.co.uk&gt;. However,
please note that this is a personal project and I spend at least 80% of my
working day writing and debugging code and answering e-mail -- in the event
that I have trouble finding sufficient time or motivating myself to do the same
thing in my spare time, I hope you'll be able to forgive me. That said, I'll
try my best to respond to as much vbSpec related mail as I can!</P>
<P><B>Q7. Are there any plans to add new features to vbSpec?</B><BR>
I have no firm plans to go on developing vbSpec, but I expect to revisit the
code from time to time to 'play' with it. Also, if I receive any patches that
contain interesting new features or optimizations, then I'll almost certainly
take some time out to add them into my development copy! </P>
<P><B>Q8. I've just added this cool new feature to vbSpec, will you include it
in the main distribution?</B><BR>
For the most part, the answer to this question is &quot;Yes&quot;. But there
are a few exceptions, the main one being that any new code must <I>work
reliably</I> and not interfere unduly with the rest of the emulation. If
possible, please also try to avoid code that relies on third-party components.
As of vbSpec version 1.20, performance is becoming a limiting factor on adding
new features. I want to try to keep the minimum required hardware down to a
266MHz PII, so patches that significantly degrade the overall performance might
not make it into the main distribution unless I can come up with a way of
optimizing everything a bit more. </P>
<P><B>Q9. Are there plans for any other VB emulators?</B><BR>
I've also written a Sinclair ZX81 emulator, called <A HREF="../vb81/index.html">vb81</A>,
that uses essentially the same Z80 core as vbSpec. I'd be interested in hearing
from anyone who is planning to use the Z80 core from vbSpec to produce other VB
emulators -- Visual Basic GameBoy, Amstrad CPC, and Jupiter ACE emulators would
be good to see!</P>
<P><B>Q10. Where can I download games to play on vbSpec?</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.void.demon.nl/spectrum.html">World of Spectrum</A> contains
a huge searchable archive of Spectrum games and related information. There are
other sites too, such as <A
HREF="http://www.spectrumarchive.freeserve.co.uk/">The Spectrum Archive</A>.
Many of the authors, publishers and copyright holders of original Spectrum
games have given their permission for their games to be distributed freely for
use with emulators such as vbSpec. <A HREF="http://www.amstrad.com/">Amstrad
plc</A>, who bought Sinclair Research Ltd in the 1980s, have kindly given
permission for the ZX Spectrum ROM images to be distributed with freeware
emulators such as vbSpec.</P>
<P><B>Q11. When I load games from TZX tape files, why doesn't the border look
right?</B><BR>
For performance reasons, the border in vbSpec is only updated 50 times per
second. On a real spectrum the border is updated much more frequently to create
the familiar effect of the border &quot;stripes&quot; that can be seen when a
program is loading from tape. Don't worry, the game will load into vbSpec
without problems, despite the non-stripey border!</P>
