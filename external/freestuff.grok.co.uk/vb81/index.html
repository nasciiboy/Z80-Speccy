<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>vb81 - Sinclair ZX81
Emulator</B></FONT> <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Hot on the heels of the
Speccy emulator, is an emulation of the Spectrum's older brother, the ZX81. It
uses the same VB core as vbSpec, but due to differences in the display hardware
and processor speed of the ZX81, this will run happily at full speed on just
about any PC that is capable of running Windows at a usable speed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><B>NOTE: </B>I haven't updated vb81 in quite 
some time, however there is a great new version of vb81 by XavSnap
which includes additional features such as an integrated disassembler
and support for additional hardware such as the Larken disk controller and both
the Memotech and G007 high-resolution graphics cards. It is available from
<a href="http://zx81.vb81.free.fr/">http://zx81.vb81.free.fr/</a> and is well worth a look!</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="+1">Features in vb81 Version
1.30</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Version 1.30 contains the following new
features:-</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Significantly faster Z80 emulation core. You
should have no problems running vb81 v1.30 at full speed in both SLOW and FAST
modes even on a relatively low-spec Windows system</FONT> </LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Improved performance of both standard and
hi-res display routines.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Fixed a couple of bugs in the keyboard support
which caused many games not to respond to key-presses.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Added new 3x display magnification
option.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">New 'Allow writes to shadow ROM area' option
allows access to the 8K-16K area of the memory map. Some games use this to
provide hi-resolution graphics and custom character sets (FROGGER- for
example).</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Fixed a bug in the interrupt routine that
caused FRAMES to be incremented wrongly. Some games such as Rocket Man froze
after a few seconds or minutes of playing.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Fixed some minor bugs in the Z80 emulation. I
believe the CPU emulation is now 100% correct in terms of timing, flag
operation, and support for undocumented opcodes -- let me know if you think
otherwise!</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Playtested against literally hundreds of ZX81
games to ensure full compatiblity. The only known problem is ZX-Xtricator,
which has a custom overscanned hi-res display routine that does not yet work
properly with vb81.</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="+1">Other Features in vb81</FONT></B> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Emulates both SLOW and FAST modes.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Emulates psuedo hi-res graphics routines as
used by innovative games such as <I>Forty Niner</I>, <I>Rock Crush</I>,
<I>Dan's Revenge</I>, and <I>Rocket Man</I>.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Supports loading and saving of standard
&quot;.P&quot; tape files used by various other ZX81 emulators.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Includes optimised 'standand' and
'double-size' display options. </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Emulates undocumented Z80 op codes, and
correctly emulates all bits of the Flags register.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Native 32-bit Windows application runs under
Windows 95, Windows 98, NT, and Win2K. </FONT> </LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Emulates Memotech's MemoCalc spreadsheet ROM.

some ZX81 games included in the ZIP file: 3D Monster Maze, The Gauntlet and
