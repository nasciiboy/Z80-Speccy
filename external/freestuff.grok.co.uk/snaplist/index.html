Snaplist is a small command-line utility that takes a ZX Spectrum .SNA snapshot
file as input and spits out an ASCII listing of any BASIC program code it
contains. The output file is compatible with Russell Marks'

utility.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">It's GPLed. That means it's free and
you get the source code. Umm... that's about it really.</FONT></P>

- The zip file contains ANSI C source code, a readme file, and binaries for
Windows and Linux (ELF, Pentium).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Philip Kendall has produced a utility called listbasic based on snaplist. It does everything snaplist does, but also supports Z80 snapshots. It's available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/fuse-utils-0.7.0.tar.gz">The World Of Spectrum</A>
as part of the fuse-utils package.</FONT></P>
