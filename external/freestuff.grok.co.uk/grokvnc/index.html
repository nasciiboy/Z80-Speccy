  <h3>Grok VNC Viewer</h3>
  <p>Grok VNC Viewer is a cross-platform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a> client. It meets the requirements for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application">portable application</a> -- that means it requires no external libraries or other software, can be run from a USB flash drive, and doesn't make any changes at all to it's host computer. The zip file contains just a single executable (or app bundle, in the case of the Mac OS X version) - just unzip it somewhere convenient and run the app to use it.</p>
  <p>The most common lossless VNC encoding methods are supported (RAW, CopyRect, RRE, and Hextile) and clipboard sharing between the local and remote hosts is supported.</p>
  <p>It's currently available for Windows (in both 32- and 64-bit incarnations), and now Mac OS X. A picture's worth a thousand words, so to save my keyboard - here is a picture of it running on a Mac:-<br /><a href="osx-screenshot.png"><img src="osx-screenshot-thumb.png" alt="Grok VNC Viewer running on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard"></a></br>(click to make it bigger, obviously)</p>
