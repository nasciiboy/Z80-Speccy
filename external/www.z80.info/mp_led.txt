Into this file you can find informations about a scrolling led display
that is cnnected to my Z80 board.

The display is made of 10 pcs. 5 x 7 LED dot matrix displays,
that give a 50 x 7 led matrix. All the anodes are connected to the
rows of the matrix. all Anodes from each display are connedted in parallel,
The 50 cathodes (5 from each display) are connected with two
National's M5450 display driver with serial control, while anodes driver
are seven bjts connected to a 3 to 8 decoder.

Thanks to the firmware on the Z80 board, you can upload or download text
into the backed-up sram with a serial (5V serial) connection, you need to
add a MAX 232 before you connect it to your PC.
The serial port is made in "software" so there is no expencive UART required.


To upload your text into memory simply write it with notepad and add in
the end the string #e. This will cause the Cpu to know that this is EOF.
you can use any serial terminal program, like win95 Hyperterminal and
the settings are 9600 baud, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity,
no hardware handshake.
To enter text, you must connect to ground input pin 1 of Z80 Board
when applying power. press h for a reminder of commands, c to upload text,
s to download, r to test.
In normal use, the input 1 must be open.

Into the text you can add the following effects:

#b - Text blink
#n - Negative text blink
#h - halt the scroll
#e - end of text, start from the top

Playing with assembly code, you can add other effects,
mail me if you make a cool one!
Also Mail me if these informations are not so clear.
As always sorry for my poor English, remember I'm Italian!
