        GENERAL DESCRIPTION

     The  Z80382  is a  high-performance  integrated  datacommunications
     processor  that  can  address several different  functions  with  a
     single device.  Major functional blocks on the Z80382 include  Z380
     processor,  3 HDLC serial channels with associated DMA,  IOM-2  bus
     interface,  2  async channels, 16550 MIMIC, PCMCIA  interface,  and
     Plug  and Play Interface logic.  A full range of  power  management
     modes are provided.

     Applications addressed by the Z80380 include High End Analog Modems
     (V.34 and beyond) and Digital Modems (ISDN, GSM cellular, Mobitex &
     Modacom).  The  Z80382  is also very well suited  for  single  chip
     controller   applications  in  ISDN  hardware  including   Terminal
     Adapters and Terminal Equipment. The Z80382 provides a  performance
     upgrade  to  existing Z80 and Z18X-based designs by  utilizing  the
     increased bandwidth of the Z380 embedded processor, while migrating
     existing customer code.

     The  Z380  microprocessor  core in the  Z80382  provides  fast  and
     efficient throughput and increased memory addressing  capabilities.
     The Z380 offers a continuing growth path for present Z80- or  Z180-
     based   designs,while   maintaining  Z80   and   Z180   object-code
     compatibility.   The   Z380   CPU   enhancements   include    added
     instructions,  expanded  16-Mbyte address space  and  flexible  bus
     interface timing.

     In  the Z380 processor core, the basic addressing modes of the  Z80
     microprocessor  have  been  augmented  to  include  Stack   Pointer
     Relative  loads and stores, 16-bit and 24-bit indexed offsets,  and
     more flexible Indirect Register addressing.  Internally, all of the
     addressing  modes  allow up to 32 bit addressing.  Its  24  address
     pins allow addressing of 16Mbytes of memory.

     Other additions to the instruction set include a full complement of
     16-bit  arithmetic and logical operations, 16-bit  I/O  operations,
     multiply  and divide, plus a complete set  of  register-to-register
     loads and exchanges.

     The Z380 register file includes alternate versions of the IX and IY
     registers. There are four banks of registers in the Z380, alongwith
     instructions for switching among them.  All of the 16-bit  register
     pairs and index registers in the basic Z80 microprocessor  register
     file are expanded to 32 bits.

     Some  features  that have traditionally been  handled  by  external
     peripherals  have been incorporated into the  Z380  microprocessor.
     These on-chip peripherals reduce system chip count, improve  system
     reliability,   reduce   overall  power   consumption,  and   reduce
     interconnection on the external bus.

     The  Z80382  provides a low power standby mode  to  minimize  power
     consumption  during system idle time, thus saving battery  life  in
     portable  applications or reducing the size and cost of the  system
     powre supply.

     The  Z80382 is packaged in two surface-mount packages -- a  144-pin
     QFP, or 144-pin VQFP for PCMCIA applications.

     To  improve  total system throughput and reduce  system  cost,  the
     Z80382  integrates on-chip peripherals and glue  logic,  summarized
     below:

     Three  HDLC  Synchronous Channels - These HDLC channels  feature  8
     byte  receive  and transmit FIFOs.  These can be used  for  modems,
     general  data  communications, and ISDN Basic Rate  Interface  when
     configured  with  the  IOM-2 bus interface.  This  points  out  the
     multiple applications that the Z80382 can address.

     The  HDLC  Channels always transfer data through the  DMA  channels
     (see  below).  A  transparent mode is selectable which  allows  use
     with non-HDLC applications such as voice or audio.  Two of the HDLC
     cells  can  be pin multiplexed with the ASCIs  (UARTs)  to  provide
     dynamically switchable (async - sync) DTE interfaces.

     8 DMA channels - These DMA channels can be dynamically assigned  to
     serve the HDLC cells, MIMIC COM ports, Host DMA Mailbox, or  ASICs,
     in  any  mixture,  making for a  very  flexible  arrangement.  They
     include  24-bit  memory  addressing  and  8  bit  memory   transfer
     capability.  Requests  are internally routed from the  HDLC  cells.

       Linked  List operation allow all HDLC Transmitters and  Receivers
     to operate at or above E1 rates simultaneously, without loading the
     bus bandwidth.

     16550 MIMIC - Provides connection to a PC ISA bus and emulation  of
     the  16550 UART register set to eliminate the need for an  external
     16550 UART, saving board space and system level cost.  Improvements
     include 16mA output drivers and Com Port Decode to reduce  external
     interface components.

     PCMCIA  Interface - Provides connectivity to PCMCIA bus with  16550
     MIMIC.  Configuration  registers  are  provided  that  comply  with
     PCMCIA  2.01  and  3.0.  Reduces the need for  an  external  PCMCIA
     interface device, which saves board space and reduces system  level
     cost.

     Plug  and  Play ISA interface - Provides a  hardware  and  software
     mechanism  for  implementing  the Plug and Play  ISA  standard  for
     automatic configuration of ISA bus resources.  Removes the need for
     an external PnP device, which saves board space and reduces  system
     level cost.

     2  ASCIs - Flexible asynchronous serial channels with  16-bit  baud
     rate  generators  for modem control and  status.  Capable  of  high
     speed asynchronous data rates up to 512Kbps.

     IOM-2 Bus Interface - Provides ISDN compatibility and time division
     multiplex  capability.  Internal  signals from this module  can  be
     connected  to  the HDLC channels to provide the B-channels  and  D-
     channel  for  ISDN  applications.  Thus,  three  channels  can   be
     configured for providing compatibility to the Basic Rate  Interface
     (2B+D) of ISDN.

     32  bit  general purpose I/O - for non-ISA  applications,  4  8-bit
     ports  are  provided  for general purpose I/O.  In  ISA  or  PCMCIA
     applications,  two of the ports are not pinned out, and  the  other
     two  are selectively multiplexed with on-chip peripheral  functions
     (ASCIs, CSI/O, PRT).  These pins are individually programmable  for
     input or output mode.

     ROM  and RAM Chip Selects with Wait State Generators - chip  select
     outputs are provided to decode memory addresses and provide  memory
     chip enables.  Each chip select has its own wait state generator to
     allow use of different speed memories.  Reduces external glue logic
     needed for decoding memory addresses.

     Dynamic  Bus  Sizing - The Z80382 includes dynamic  bus  sizing  to
     allow  any mix of 16 and 8 bit memory and I/O devices in a  system.
     One application of using this capability would be to copy code from
     a  low-cost,  slow 8 bit ROM to 16 bit RAM, from which  it  can  be
     executed at much higher speed.  Memory bus sizes can be  configured
     internally by software, to eliminate the need for external logic to
     drive MSIZE.

     2  16 bit timers - with flexible prescalers for wide-range  timing.
     Preserves accuracy/granularity at any point in the timing range.

     CSIO - Clocked serial I/O can be used for serial memory  interface.
     Provides  a  simple  way to make  high-speed  data  connections  to
     another microprocessor.

     Watch  Dog  Timer - A watchdog timer is provided  to  prevent  code
     runaway  and  possible resulting system damage.  A  range  of  time
     constants  is provided as on the Z80185.  The /RESET input  can  be
     forced as an output upon the terminal count of the Watch Dog Timer.
     This allows external peripherals to be reset along with the Z80382.

     Clock multiply and divide-by-2 options - Clock multiply allows  the
     use  of  slower  frequency, less noisy,  less  expensive  crystals.
     Saves board level cost and reduces noise impact during board  level
     qualification.
