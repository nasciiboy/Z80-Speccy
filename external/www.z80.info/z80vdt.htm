<H2>Video Display Terminals based on Z80 Family</H2>
<P>
If there are popular Video Display Terminals based on Z80 family, 
you know of or you would like to point to, please tell me,
or - even better - contact me if you are ready to maintain 
any "z80vdt*" sub page not yet existing, nicely fitting into 
my Z80 series of documents.

<li>Visual Technology was one of the largest OEM and graphics terminal manufacturers during the 1980's.<br>
The following units were all Z80 based systems.<br>
V-100 / 110<br>
V-200 --- Actually their first model<br>
V-220<br>
SRI-100<br>
V-230<br>
V-3xx - (SPR170, 383, 320, 330)<br>
V-400<br>
V-420 -- Graphics BW - V-430 was color<br>
V-500 / 550 - Graphics BW<br>
V-102 and V-102G - Graphics BW (G option)<br>
V-50 / 55/ 60 /65 - the housing was actually the case from the V-1050 monitor (9" green).<br>
The low profile keyboard was the same too.<p>
Their units were found all over the world and were custom made (SPR units) for long lost companies such as Burroughs, Infinet (Intertel), Microtouch, etc.
During the early 80's (1982 or 1983) they bought Ontel Corporation and merged their product lines into Visuals. Ontel continued to manufacture
their own equipment until 1985 when all manufacturing was moved to Lowell, Massachusetts. Ontel made all kinds of terminal and pc-like products. Among
them was the Amigo - a CP/M 2.2 based system that was quite small and really odd shaped. It had an IBM style keyboard, and came loaded with a ton of
other software. Visual's answer to this model was their V-1050. The V-1050 was a square-ish unit with a nice 9" monitor that fit on top. The keyboard
was the same - low-profile one used on many of their terminals built around the same time - as in the one for the V-50/55 and 60/65 and V-102. The
V-1050 also sported more memory which was accessed via paging or bank-swapping. The software bundle was about the same - Word Star, DR-Graph,
Microsoft Multi-plan, C-Basic, and a Z80 Assembler. The only thing is that the 1050 ran CP/M Plus (3.3 not 2.2) Through a special utility you could
insert, and read, disks from Kaypro, DEC, Osborne, and IBM, Ontel Amigo, etc. I owned a 1050 until recently. Both the Amigo and the 1050 used a Z-80
for the main cpu and a 6502 for the graphics.<p>
The V-42x series was also an interesting. They used two Z80 processors. One was dedicated for regular terminal work. The other worked in conjunction
with a 720D GPU that had the primitives built in for graphing and GTCO plotting and other cad work. <br>
