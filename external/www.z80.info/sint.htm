                Short RST for Z80

                        Abstract
 Z80 is a 8bit micro-processor  by  Zilog,  frequently  used
several  years ago. However it seems old fashoned now, it is
important one as education of MPU. I studied the  method  to
do RST 38h with conditions.


1.Introduction
 Z80 was widely used MPU in '70-80 but now  it  is  commonly
used  as  a  micro controler. It has 8 channels of interrupt
vector in INT-0 mode, one channel in INT-1 and 256  channels
in  INT-2.  In  case  of  INT-0 mode, the vectors are 0000h,
0008h, 0010h, 0018h, 0020h, 0028h, 0030h and 0038h. In INT-1
mode, 0038h only. In the other case, the vectors are decided
with I-register and I/O.
 Especially 0038h is important. 38h is the vector address in
both  mode  0  and  1.  In addition, for instance, PC-8801's
0038h is the gate to MON command of BASIC,  MSX's  0038h  is
the unique vector because MSX use INT mode 1.
 I studied about RST 38h due to the reason.


2.Study
 It is the ordinaly method for Z80 users to RST 38h  with  a
condition;

        JR      Ncondition, LABEL
	RST     38h
LABEL:  ...

For example, to do RST if carryed, they will write

        JR      NC, L01
	RST     38h
L01:    RET             ; No work...

 But I can write it shorter, only two bytes. I will write as
follow;

        JR      condition, -1   ; -1 == FFh

Because JR,  which  is  short(-128  to  +127)  jump  with  a
condition,  is  two bytes instruction of Z80, and RST, which
is software interruption, is  coded  as  'FFh'  for  RST  to
0038h.
 The short jump of JR mnemonic does jump after increments of
program counter of Z80, such as;

[JR     C, -1]
	PC+=2;          /*  JR is 2 byte.  */
        if(C) PC-=1;    /*  See below  */

If carried, PC will let +1 (+2-1). In the address, the  next
byte  of  the top of JR, 'FFh' exists! That is RST 38h. This
is the conditioned short RST of Z80.
