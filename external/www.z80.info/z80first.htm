Yes, this system is made by me <a href="contact.htm">Thomas Scherrer</a><br>

My First Z80 system</center>
<p>
1: 7493, clock divider<br>
2: 7493, clock divider<br>
3: 7493, clock divider<br>
4: 7493, clock divider, the CPU runs a 1KHz, so I did not require any delay loops :-)<br>
<br>
A1: 74138, CE RAM.<br>
A2: 74138, CE both PIO'S.<br>
A3: 74138, WR clock pulse to O1 and O2, with 7414 and 7432<br>
74123: is a reset timer, used to give reset in a specified time after power-up or reset-button<br>
<br>
O1: AM2952, Output Latch for the Display Address and control.<br>
O1: AM2952, Output Latch for the Display Data Bus, 7bit.<br>
<br>
RAM: 8 Kb, A special one made of 4 SMD 6116 (2 more at the bottom of the IC) and a decoder, nice eh?<br>
EPROM: 2732, 4Kb I will rip the data from this soon..<br>
Z80 CPU:  A special military temperature range type<br>
PIO: a pair of 8255' are used, one for the PARALLEL port, the other is for future use.<br> 
DISPLAY: LED ASCII DL2416 from HP, they look really cool.<br>
<br>
The DIP-Switch are connected to the first PIO.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I don't have the schematics for this system (yet), I did this back in 1990 at that time I started my education.<p>
<hr>
Some of my first assembler programs for this system, was written and assembled by hand !! here is my old original papers<br>
All hex data was then programmed into an EPROM 2732 bit for bit in my own homemade EPROM programmer.<br>
<a href="gfx/firstram1.gif">RAM TEST 1</A> A memory test program that works<br>
<a href="gfx/firstram2.gif">RAM TEST 2</A> Display write routine for ram test "RAM IS 100% OK !"<br>
<a href="gfx/firstram3.gif">RAM TEST 3</A> Display write routine for ram test "RAM FAIL *FEJL* "<br>
<a href="gfx/firstram4.gif">RAM TEST 4</A> Display write routine for ram test "RAM-TEST RUNNING"<br>
<hr>
Another program called "Pulser" it uses both INT and NMI interrupts for inputs<br>
<a href="gfx/firstpuls1.gif">PULSER 1</A> Main program 1<br>
this program has also the display write routine like ram test placed at:<br>
100H writing "CENTRONIKS PORT "<BR>
200H writing "EPROMER +128 ADR"<BR>
300H writing "STOP,PRESS RESET"<br>
