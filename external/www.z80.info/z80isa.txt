This is an excerpt from Jim Delaney's e-mail, explaining what this card 
is all about.

-----------------

So, I thought you might like to look at a Z80 PC ISA Card I constructed,
designed, and programmed all myself between 1999-2001. I call it the
DESCATOC Card - this stands for Delaney's Energy Saving Computer And
Telecommunication Operations Card.

[...] so that anyone with any skill and knowledge of Electronics can build it
himself, I want to provide all DOC's and Software except ROM chip
Software. For this, People can pay me a small fee, and I will program a
chip for them. This also allows me to see how many are interested in
building it. Their is a lot of DOS Software for it, indeed, it all runs
under DOS or in a DOS box. it will though all fit into an 8Mb ZIP file.

I designed it primarily so that people could leave their BBS and FAX
Computer Hosts fully powered off until a call came in, the Card would
then switch on the PC and tell the PC What Software to run in order to
take the call. After the call, the PC tells the Card to initiate a
software controlled power down sequence whereby the Card brings the PC
out of its OS, and then disconnects the PC's mains power. the card then goes
into waiting for another incoming call. Thus, the PC is only on when it it is
needed. and off all other times. thieir is a new peice of software for
the PC out called GotoMyPC and it is totally incredible! (see
www.gotomypc.com) it would be an ideal companion for it.
The Card uses parallel communication procedures using the ISA Bus, but
it could easilly be converted to Printer Port Operation. The Card
decodes PC I/O addresses between 200 - 400h in the PC's I/O map, and
only occupies 2 of the PC's 65535 possible I/O ports their. the actual
position it occupies can be selected by DIP Switches onboard the card.
it also uses 3 x Z80 PIO IC's giving 6 x programmable 8 bit I/O Ports,
which then drive the other IC's, which basically amount to on board
peripherals. In the picture far right and to the bottom is the BIOS ROM,
above this is the Z80, above that are 2 x 1k RAM's, the the TTL Clock
runing at 4Mhz. An interesting feature of the Cards functions is that it
can turn on or off at will its own NMI pulse !
