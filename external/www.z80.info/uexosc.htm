<h2>Crystal Oscillator Circuits</h2>
<hr>
A well-designed crystal oscillator will provide good performance with TTL gates.<br>
Two types of crystal oscillator circuits can be used:<br>
One with series resonance, or one with parallel resonance.<hr>

<IMG ALIGN=CENTER SRC="gfx/parallel.gif" alt="Parallel X-tal osc" border=1 width=576 height=480><p>
The Figure above shows implementation of a parallel resonant oscillator circuit.<br>
The circuit is designed to use the fundamental frequency of the crystal. <br>
The 74AS04 inverter performs the 180-degree phase shift that a parallel oscillator requires.<br>
The 4K7 resistor provides the negative feedback for stability.<br>
The 10K potentiometer biases the 74AS04 in the linear region. This could be used for external oscillator designs.

<IMG ALIGN=CENTER SRC="gfx/series.gif" alt="Series X-Tal osc" border=1 width=602 height=302><p>
The Figure above shows implementation of a series resonant oscillator circuit.<br>
The circuit is also designed to use the fundamental frequency of the crystal. <br>
The inverter performs a 180-degree phase shift in a series resonant oscillator circuit.<br>
The 330 Ohm resistors provide the negative feedback to bias the inverter in their linear region.<br>

The Figure above shows implementation of a series resonant oscillator circuit, using TTL NAND GATES.<br>
This circuit is <b>tested</b> by <a href="contact.htm">me</a> and found working with the following IC types:<br>
<b>7400</b> Total current consumption is 21 mA. <br>
<b>74LS00</b> Total current consumption is 15 mA. <br>
<b>74HCT00</b> Don't use this type, it will NOT work, because the HCT type is too fast.<br>

The parallel resonator above doesnt work with 74HCT04. Well, in fact it doesnt.<br>
But it's not because the HCT technology is faster than LS, or, too fast.<br>
In fact the propagation delay is similar in HCT and LS. <br>
What really happens is that the HCT technology has a higher gain, that is,<br>
the inverter has a mutch sharper characteristic than LS devices.<br>
So, with that configuration, it gets very dificult do biase the inverter in the liner or high gain region.<br>
Nevertheless, because the HCT is a low power technology, and nowadays preferable,<br>
there's a very simple circuit to build clocks with HCT. I think that you know the configuration,<br>
yet I leave it here just in case you dont. Note that this configuration<br>
doesnt  work with LS because of the gain being to low to biase the inverter.<br>
