<h2>Contact the z80.info webmaster</h2>
<P>
Please note that Thomas Scherrer, the original maintainer of this site, is
- for various reasons - unable to continue the site, therefore he asked me to do it for him.
As I host a couple of other sites, too, you will hopefully understand that my time
is quite limited. </P>
<p>
Of course, you are welcome to contact me if you have a serious question, 
or some good z80 relevant information. Please don't expect me to answer your questions,
though, as <B>I'm not familiar with z80 programming</B>. And please remember that you 
find a couple of links on this site which will more likely answer your questions
than I can do. </P>
<p>
You can write in English, German or Italian. Please <B>do not send any attachments</B> if
I didn't ask you to do so. If you think you got something I should have, just let me know,
and I'll give you further instruction. <BR>
If you've got any corrections and/or additions, please remember to include the
<b>URL</b> of the page you want to be updated.
<BR>And one last reminder: <B>I AM A WOMAN</B>, so please don't call me "Sir".....
</P>
<P>O.K. If you've read all this carefully and you found that you still want to send
me an e-mail, then take the following link:
<BR>
