You should have used the Z80 built in refresh.  If you need 8 bits all you
need is to interrupt at half the maximum refresh interval and invert the
upper bit of the refresh register.  Your interrupt routine looks like this:

        PUSH    AF
        LD      A,R
        XOR     80H
        LD      R,A
        POP     AF
        EI
        RETI

If your DRAM needs 256 refreshes every 4ms, you just need an interrupt every
2ms.  If you're using only a 2.5MHz clock, this would cost you .003% of your
Z80 capacity (assuming 75 clocks to handle the interrupt).
