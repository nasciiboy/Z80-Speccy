   Some Ramblings About NiCd Batteries
   
   Author: Ken A. Nishimura (KO6AF)
   
   I have decided to write this diatribe due to the continuing Ni-Cd
   battery saga. Yes, batteries are LOW tech -- they can't compare to the
   bells and whistles of our latest HTs, but... your new HT is but a
   paperweight (albeit an expensive one) without power from your
   batteries. This is not a response to any particular prior post, and is
   unsolicited, so in short, I'm not flaming anyone.... But, I thought it
   may be useful, so, without further ado, let us take a more careful
   look into NiCd battery management.
   
   Note:
   
    1. The stuff below glosses over some of the more technical nitty
       gritty details. I wanted it to be shorter than 50K Bytes!
    2. I actively solicit corrections, both technical and editorial. If
       you have information contrary to that presented below, please let
       me know. Flames, on the other hand, are summarily disregarded, as
       usual.

1.3) Credo #1: Charge control is the key to battery management

   More batteries are destroyed or damaged by bad charging techniques
   than all other causes combined. Once a battery reaches full charge,
   the charging current has to go somewhere -- most often, generating
   heat and gases. Both are bad for batteries.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.4) How does a Ni-Cd battery work?

   Let us answer this with another question. How does a electrochemical
   cell work?
   
   First, a bit of nomenclature. A cell is a single electrochemical
   device with a single anode and a single cathode. A battery is a
   collection of cells, usually connected in series to obtain a higher
   terminal voltage.
   
   Batteries, whether they are primary (use once) or secondary
   (rechargeable) are devices which convert chemical energy into
   electrical energy. In the case of the latter, they can take electrical
   energy and store it as chemical energy for later use.
   
   The key to electrochemistry are the processes of oxidation and
   reduction. Remember the phrase" "LEO (the lion) goes GER (grr??) " --
   Lose Electrons Oxidation -- Gain Electrons Reduction. When one
   oxidizes a material, it gives up electrons it becomes more positively
   charged, or enters a higher oxidation state. Likewise, when one
   reduces a material, one is adding electrons to it and either making it
   negatively charged or reducing its oxidation state.
   
   Now, one can make a cell using two materials, say A and B and
   immersing them in a solution which can conduct ions, called an
   electrolyte. (An ion is a charged atom or radical of a molecule
   capable of transferring electrical charge). Now, let us say that
   material A is easily oxidized -- it likes to lose electrons, while B
   is a material that likes to be reduced. When these two materials are
   immersed in an electrolyte, and a circuit is completed from A to B, A
   is oxidized and electrons are released to flow to the circuit. After
   performing electrical work, the electrons flow into B, where B is
   reduced. The circuit from B to A is completed by the flow of ions in
   the electrolyte. A secondary cell can be reversed by forcing electrons
   into A, and reducing the oxidized A to regain unoxidized A for use
   again.
   
   This, of course, is an oversimplified view, as only certain
   combinations of materials and electrolytes provides useful and
   practical batteries.
   
   Oh, one more bit of nomenclature: The cathode is where reduction takes
   place, and the anode is where oxidation takes place. So, in a battery
   which is producing current, the positive terminal is the cathode, and
   the negative terminal is the anode. Yes, this is counterintuitive from
   our understanding of diodes, where the cathode is negative with
   respect to the anode...
   
   Now, the NiCd system itself:
   
   When the cell is fully charged:
   
   The cathode is composed of Nickelic Hydroxide.
   
   Now, nickel is one of those elements that has multiple oxidation
   states -- it can lose a different number of electrons per atom,
   depending on how hard it is coerced. Nickel is usually found with
   oxidation states of 0 (free metal), +2, +3 and +4. The +2 state is
   referred with a -ous suffix, while the +3 and +4 states are referred
   with a -ic suffix. So, nickelic hydroxide is really NiOOH (the nickel
   has a charge of +3) or

Ni(OH) (the nickel has a charge of +4)
      4

   
   The anode is composed of free cadmium metal (zero oxidation).
   
   The electrolyte is usually a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH).
   
   When one connects a load to the cell, as explained earlier, the anode
   is oxidized and the cathode is reduced. Electrons leave the anode
   where the cadmium is oxidized and forms:
   
Cd(OH) , plus 2 free electrons.
      2

   
   These two electrons go to the cathode where they reduce the nickelIC
   hydroxide to form nickelOUS hydroxide or:

Ni(OH) (where the nickel has
      2

   
   a charge of +2)
   
   This reaction can take place until the materials are exhausted. In
   theory, cells are manufactured so that both anode and cathode are
   spent at roughly equal rates.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.5) OK, so what happens when cells are charged?

   Well, in a nutshell, the inverse of the discharge. To charge, one is
   forcing current back into the cell (opposite of discharge current).
   Here, electrons are being taken out of the positive terminal, and
   forced into the negative terminal. This means that the material at the
   positive terminal is being oxidized (hence is now the anode --
   confusing, eh?) and material at the negative terminal is being reduced
   (now the cathode).
   
   In the NiCd system, the cadmium hydroxide is being re-converted into
   cadmium, and the nickelous hydroxide is being re-converted to nickelic
   hydroxide.
   
   Note that the electrolyte in both charge and discharge is a means to
   move the hydroxyl (OH-) ions around. Unlike the lead-acid system, the
   electrolyte really doesn't change in composition too much between the
   charged and discharged state.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.6) OK, so what's so tricky?

   The easy part of charging is reconverting the spent material on the
   plates to the charged condition. The hard part is knowing when to
   stop. Let us take a moment to think about what happens when we
   overcharge the battery. Once all the nickelous hydroxide is converted
   into nickelic hydroxide, and in theory all the cadmium hydroxide is
   converted into cadmium, the charging current has to go somewhere. As
   the energy of the charging current cannot go into more chemical
   energy, it goes into splitting water (water is still the major
   constituent of the electrolyte). Just like the age old chemistry
   experiment of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, a fully
   charged NiCd cell does the same thing. You are forcing oxidation at
   the positive terminal and reduction at the negative. When one oxidizes
   water (actually the OH-) ion, one produces oxygen. Likewise, at the
   negative terminal (now the cathode), one produces hydrogen.
   
   This of course is bad. Oxygen + hydrogen = BOOM. Cell manufacturers,
   or at least their lawyers, frown on this from happening. So, they
   cheat. During manufacture, they deliberately oversize the negative
   plate, and they partially discharge it. That is, they put a fully
   charged positive plate, but put a slightly discharged, but bigger
   plate of cadmium in. The amount of free cadmium in the oversized plate
   is matched to discharge in step with the amount of nickelic hydroxide
   provided in the positive plate.
   
   Now consider what happens as full charge is achieved. Oxidation of
   water starts at the anode, but since the cathode is oversized, and has
   excess hydroxide, the current continues to produce cadmium metal
   instead of hydrogen. At the same time, the separator (the material
   used to prevent the plates from shorting) is designed to allow oxygen
   gas to diffuse through, from the positive to the negative plate. The
   free oxygen then oxidizes the cadmium metal to form more cadmium
   hydroxide to prevent hydrogen from being formed. Voila -- a safe
   battery.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.7) OK, so it looks like batteries are well protected. Now what?

   Not so fast..... this scheme will work only as long as the
   overcharging current is limited to a value such that the rate of
   oxygen liberation at the anode is less than or equal to the rate of
   diffusion across the separator. If the overcharging current is too
   high, excess oxygen is produced at the anode, and since not enough
   oxygen can diffuse across to make up for the reduction at the cathode,
   the excess cadmium hydroxide is used up. Then, hydrogen is formed.
   This leads to a dangerous situation, due to both fire and
   overpressure. Cells are designed to vent when this condition occurs,
   releasing the excess hydrogen and oxygen to the air before really bad
   things happen. While this may keep one's cells from blowing up, it
   does damage them, since one is losing material from one's cell. As one
   loses water, it upsets the chemical balance inside the cell -- lose
   enough water, and it stops working.
   
   Another problem is that the process of generating oxygen, and
   recombining it at the cathode generates heat. With a moderate amount
   of current, the cell temperature can rise considerably, to 50 or 60
   degrees C. If after charging, the batteries are hot, then you have
   overcharged them -- slap yourself on your wrist...
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.8) Credo #2: Heat is the enemy of batteries

   A NiCd stored, used, or charged under high temperature conditions will
   die an early death. Heat causes the separator to weaken, the seals to
   weaken, and greatly accelerates changes in the plate material, some of
   which cause the dreaded memory effect.
   
   So even though the cells may not vent, the heat by-product is wearing
   down the cells. Specifically, hydrolysis or degradation of the
   separator material, usually polyamide, is greatly accelerated at high
   temperatures. This leads to premature cell failure (see below).
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.9) What are battery manufacturers doing to prevent damage from overcharging?

   Quite a lot. The demand for rapid charging has lead to a great
   increase in overcharging abuse. Most all NiCd cells can be rapid
   charged. The trick is to stop charging when it is fully charged. The
   so called "rapid charge" type of cells just incorporate protection
   against overcharging at high currents. Most often, this is done with
   activated carbon inserted in the cell to promote the collection of
   oxygen and to deliver it to the cathode for recombination. By
   increasing the rate of oxygen transport, one is increasing the ability
   of the cell to resist venting. Note however, that heat is still
   generated.
   
   The price one pays for this is reduced capacity. Everything takes
   space in the cell, and space for carbon means less space for active
   material. Also, there have been some indications that carbon can cause
   the cadmium metal to corrode, possibly leading to a shorter life.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.10) How about those high-temp batteries?

   There are ways to make NiCd cells more resistant to the damaging
   effects of heat. Mainly, using polypropylene separators and changing
   the electrolyte to sodium hydroxide makes the cells more durable under
   high temperatures. However, the cost is higher, and the internal
   resistance is raised, making high current discharge more difficult.
   Unless one knows that cells will be used at high temperatures, don't
   bother -- learn to take care of the cells to avoid overheating them.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.11) What about those super-high capacity cells?

   Yup, the manufacturers are in a numbers game. It used to be that AA
   cells were 450 mAh. Then came 500, then 600 mAh. Now, 700, 800 and
   even 900 mAh cells are available. Next year, Sanyo will introduce a
   950 mAh cell. OK, so what's going on? Well, the highest capacity cells
   use foamy or spongy backing material for their plates. This allows
   packing more active material into the plates, but the cost is higher
   resistance. Recall that one of the great virtues of NiCds is their low
   internal resistance -- this allows large discharge currents for
   transmitting, for example.
   
   So far, the highest capacity sintered plate (best for low resistance)
   cell I have seen is the Sanyo KR-800 cell, rated at 800 mAh.
   
   The Panasonic 900 mAh cell is of the foam type, and may work for a
   specific application, but expect higher resistance. I also suspect
   (but am not sure) that the Millenium cells are also foam type. For
   most consumer applications, the internal resistance isn't an issue --
   for high power transmitting (e.g. more than 1A of current), it can be
   a concern.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.12) Does the memory effect exist?

   <Flame shields on> YES
   
   Just as everyone is running around and saying that the memory effect
   is a myth, here I am, saying that it is true. OK, so, why is this?
   First of all, the term memory effect is quite unscientific. People
   tend to attribute any failure of a NiCd to memory.
   
   Let us define memory as the phenomenon where the discharge voltage for
   a given load is lower than it should be. This can give the appearance
   of a lowered capacity, while in reality, it is more accurate to term
   it voltage depression.
   
   Memory is also hard to reproduce, which makes it hard to study.
   Originally, memory effect was seen in spacecraft batteries subjected
   to a repeated discharge/charge cycle that was a fixed percentage of
   total capacity (due to the earth's shadow). After many cycles, when
   called upon to provide the full capacity, the battery failed to do so.
   Since we aren't in space, the above is not really relevant...
   
   Let us look at various causes of "memory" or voltage depression.
   
   Memory can be attributed to changes in the negative or cadmium plate.
   Recall that charging involves converting
   
Cd(0H) to Cd metal.
      2

   
   Ordinarily, and under moderate charging currents, the cadmium that is
   deposited is microcrystalline (i.e. very small crystals). Now,
   metallurgical thermodynamics states that grain boundaries (boundaries
   between the crystals) are high energy regions, and given time, the
   tendency of metals is for the grains to coalesce and form larger
   crystals. This is bad for the battery since it makes the cadmium
   harder to dissolve during high current discharge, and leads to high
   internal resistance and voltage depression.
   
   The trick to avoiding memory is avoiding forming large crystal
   cadmium. Very slow charging is bad, as slow growth aids large crystal
   growth (recall growing rock candy). High temperatures are bad, since
   the nucleation and growth of crystals is exponentially driven by
   temperature. The problem is that given time, one will get growth of
   cadmium crystals, and thus, one needs to reform the material. Partial
   cycling of the cells means that the material deep with the plate never
   gets reformed. This leads to a growth of the crystals. By a proper
   execution of a discharge/charge cycle, one destroys the large crystal
   cadmium and replace it with a microcrystalline form best for
   discharge.
   
   This does NOT mean that one needs to cycle one's battery each time it
   is used. This does more harm than good, and unless it is done on a per
   cell basis, one risks reversing the cells and that really kills them.
   Perhaps once in a while, use the pack until it is 90% discharged, or
   to a cell voltage of 1.0V under light load. Here, about 95% of the
   cells capacity is used, and for all intensive purposes, is discharged.
   At this point, recharge it properly, and that's it.
   
   The more common "memory effect" isn't memory at all, but voltage
   depression caused by overcharging. Positive plate electrochemistry is
   very complicated, but overcharging changes the crystal structure of
   the nickelic hydroxide from beta-Nickelic Hydroxide to gamma-Nickelic
   hydroxide. The electrochemical potential of the gamma form is about 40
   to 50 mV less than the beta form. This results in a lower discharge
   voltage. In a six cell (7.2v) pack, this means a loss of 300 mV.
   Trick? Don't overcharge. Leaving cells on a trickle charger encourages
   formation of gamma nickelic hydroxide. Expect the cells to discharge
   at a lower voltage.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.13) Summary

     * DON'T deliberately discharge the batteries to avoid memory
     * DO let the cells discharge to 1.0V/cell on occasion through normal
       use.
     * DON'T leave the cells on trickle charge for long times, unless
       voltage depression can be tolerated.
     * DO protect the cells from high temperature both in charging and
       storage.
     * DON'T overcharge the cells. Use a good charging technique.
     * DO choose cells wisely. Sponge/foam plates will not tolerate high
       charge/discharge currents as well as sintered plate.
       
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.14) OK, so I need to "properly" charge cells. How do I do that?

   There are many methods of charging. One is trickle or the old 15 hour
   method. This involves using a current of about 50 mA (for AA cells)
   and leaving them on charge for 15 hours. At this current level, oxygen
   diffusion is more than enough to take care of the excess current once
   full charge is achieved. Of course, one runs the risk of voltage
   depression due to overcharge.
   
   The best method is the so called delta-V method. If one plots the
   terminal voltage of the cell during a charge with a constant voltage,
   it will continue to rise slowly as charging progresses. At the point
   of full charge, the cell voltage will drop in a fairly short time. The
   amount of drop is small, about 10 mV/cell, but is distinctive. There
   are circuits out there built specifically to look for this. The Maxim
   MAX712 and 713 ICs are ones that come to mind now. This method is
   expensive and tedious, but gives good reproducible results. There is a
   danger in this though. In a battery with a bad cell this delta - V
   method may not work, and one may end up destroying all the cells, so
   one needs to be careful. If one ends up putting in more than double
   the charge capacity of the cell, then something is wrong.
   
   Another cheap way is to measure the cell temperature. The cell
   temperature will rise steeply as full charge is reached. When the cell
   temperature rises to 10 degrees C or so above ambient, stop charging,
   or go into trickle mode.
   
   Whatever method one chooses, a failsafe timer is a requirement with
   high charge currents. Don't let more than double the cell capacity of
   charge current flow, just in case. (i.e. for a 800 mAh cell, no more
   than 1600 mAh of charge).
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.15) I've seen terminology like "C/n" where n is a number. What gives?

   This is a method of expressing current as a fraction of the Ah rating
   of a cell. Simply, a 100 mA current means much more to a small N cell
   than to a large D cell. So, rather than use absolute units of amperes,
   cell manufacturers often use fractions of cell capacity, or C. A
   typical good AA cell has a capacity of 700 mAh, so C = 700 mA. A
   current of C/10 is therefore 70 mA, while C/2 is 350 mA.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.16) So, what's the right charge current?

   Depends. If using an unregulated charger -- one that doesn't do any
   detection of full charge, then one must restrict your charge current
   to the overcharge capacity of your cell. All NiCd cells I have seen
   can handle C/10 (approx. 50 mA for AA cell) indefinitely without
   venting. This is not to say that one won't get voltage depression, but
   rather that one won't destroy the cell(s).
   
   If one wants to get a bit more aggressive, a C/3 charge will recharge
   the cells in about 4 hours, and at this rate, most cells will handle a
   bit of overcharge without too much trouble. That is, if one catches
   the cells within an hour of full charge, things should be OK. No
   overcharge is best of course.
   
   Only with automatic means of full charge detection should one use
   charge currents above C/2. At this current level and above, many cells
   can be easily damaged by overcharging. Those that have oxygen
   absorbers may not vent, but will still get quite hot.
   
   With a good charge control circuit, charge currents in excess of C
   have been used -- the problem here becomes reduced charge efficiency
   and internal heating from ohmic losses. Unless one is in a great
   hurry, avoid rates greater than C.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
1.17) You mentioned cell reversal. What is that, and why is it so bad?

   In a battery, not all cells are created equal. One will be weaker than
   the others. So, as the battery is discharged, the weakest cell will
   use up all its active material. Now, as discharge continues, the
   current through the dead cell becomes a charging current, except that
   it is reversed. So, now reduction is occurring at the positive
   terminal. As there is no more nickelic hydroxide, it reduces the
   water, and produces hydrogen. Cell pressure builds, and it vents. The
   cell has lost water and the life of the cell has been shortened
   
   This is the big danger of battery cycling to prevent memory.
   Invariably, unless one is very careful, one ends up reversing a cell.
   It does much more harm than the cycling does good. Also, keep in mind
   that cells to have a finite life. Each cycle is a bit of life.

1.18) Credo #3: Take care of your cells, and they will take care of you

   I have a set of cells from 1981 that are still working. Sintered
   plate, 450 mAh old technology -- originally trickle charged, now rapid
   charged many times using a delta-V technique.

1.19) OK, my cells died. I was nice to them, what happened?

   All good things must come to an end. No matter how well one takes care
   of the cells, they will eventually die. There are two main reasons
   cells fail, other than abuse. One is separator failure, and the other
   is degradation of the active material. The first is far more common,
   and the result is a shorted cell. Every time a cell is charged, the
   active material is redeposited on the plates. Ideally, this occurs
   uniformly across the surface of the plate.
   
   However, in reality, there will be bumps and valleys. When there are
   bumps on both the positive and negative plates are adjacent, separated
   only by the separator, the resistance between those two points is
   slightly less than in other regions of the cell. So, the current
   density there rises. This means that more material is deposited there,
   contributing to even more "bumpiness". In reality, needles called
   dendrites form, and given time, they can force themselves through the
   separator to short the cell.
   
   A cell that appears to self-discharge in a couple of days has dendrite
   problems, and will soon completely short out. Plan to replace the
   cell.
   
   Degradation of the active plate material is just a normal aging
   process of cycling. Both of these mechanisms are very good reasons to
   avoid cycling the cells after each use. Cells should live to about
   1000 cycles if treated properly. Anything over that is gravy.

1.20) I've seen people talk about zapping cells to revive them

   Yup -- a quick fix it. When cells short due to dendrites, the piece of
   material that is actually shorting the cell is very thin. So, by
   forcing a huge impulse of current into the cell, one can vaporize the
   dendrite -- sort of blowing a fuse.
   
   This works, and can revive an otherwise shorted cell. However, it is a
   stopgap measure at best. First, the fact that one dendrite has formed
   means that another is not too far behind. Second, the material that
   was vaporized has now permeated the separator material, forming a
   resistor that shorts the plates. The cell may no longer be shorted,
   but will still have a poor charge retention.
   
   Besides, unless done properly, this can be dangerous as large currents
   are necessary.

1.21) How about self-discharge?

   Yes, NiCds have a bad habit of going dead when you just leave them.
   Fortunately you can recharge them. The current cells discharge about 1
   percent a day, maybe a bit less. Expect them to be mostly flat after 3
   months. Unfortunately, the so called 15 hour trickle chargers more
   than make up for self-discharge. In fact most of the current goes to
   making oxygen, not making up for self-discharge. If you want to make
   something to keep your cells from self-discharging, make a 1 to 2 mA
   current source. That should more than overcome self-discharge.

1.22) What about NiMH cells?

   NiMH or nickel metal-hydride cells are a promising alternative to
   NiCds. They use hydrides (metals capable of storing hydrogen) as the
   negative material in lieu of cadmium. They have higher capacity for
   the same size cell, and don't use toxic cadmium. They also are
   advertised as not suffering from memory.
   
   The downside: They are expensive (all new technology is). They have a
   horrible self-discharge rate (I have measured between 3 to 10 percent
   per day -- useless after 1 month). They are trickier to charge. Delta
   V works, but the voltage drop is very small (2.5 mV/cell). Better to
   charge them to a point where the voltage stops rising. And, yes, the
   same thing goes with hydrides as with cadmium. They can suffer from
   memory, though it is much harder to see than in NiCds. Expect to see a
   bit less touting of the "memory free" operation of NiMH cells in the
   future.

1.23) What if I want to learn even more about NiCds and other batteries?

   There are several good texts on batteries. One is quite new and
   contains fairly contemporary material:

 Chapter 2) General Electric's tech. note regarding memory, by Bob Myers KC0EW
                                       
   From General Electric's tech. note regarding memory
   (posted without permission and any errors are my own):
   
   
          "Among the many users of batteries in both the industrial and
          consumer sectors, the idea of a memory phenomenon in
          nickel-cadmium batteries has been widely misused and
          understood. The term 'memory' has become a catch-all 'buzzword'
          that is used to describe a raft of application problems, being
          most often confused with simple voltage depression.
          
          To the well informed, however, 'memory' is a term applied to a
          specific phenomenon encountered very infrequently [emphasis
          mine - RLM] in field applications. Specifically, the term
          'memory' came from an aerospace nickel-cadmium application in
          which the cells were repeatedly discharged to 25% of available
          capacity (plus or minus 1%) by exacting computer control, then
          recharged to 100% capacity WITHOUT OVERCHARGE [emphasis in the
          original]. This long term, repetitive cycle regime, with no
          provisions for overcharge, resulted in a loss of capacity
          beyond the 25% discharge point. Hence the birth of a "memory"
          phenomenon, whereby nickel-cadmium batteries purportedly lose
          capacity if repeatedly discharged to a specific level of
          capacity.
          
          The 'memory' phenomenon observed in this original aerospace
          application was eliminated by simply reprogramming the computer
          to allow for overcharging. [Note that no mention is made of
          adding an intentional *discharge* to clear the problem - RLM]
          In fact, 'memory' is always a completely reversible condition;
          even in those rare cases where 'memory' cannot be avoided, it
          can easily be erased. Unfortunately, the idea of memory-related
          loss of capacity has been with us since. Realistically,
          however, 'memory' CANNOT exist if ANY ONE of the following
          conditions holds:
          
         1. Batteries achieve full overcharge.
         2. Discharge is not exactly the same each cycle - plus or minus
            2-3%
         3. Discharge is to less than 1.0 volt per cell.
            
          
          Remember, the existence of any ONE of these conditions
          eliminates the possibility of 'memory'. GE has not verified
          true 'memory' in any field application with the single
          exception of the satellite application noted above. Lack of
          empirical evidence notwithstanding, 'memory' is still blamed
          regularly for poor battery performance that is caused by a
          number of simple, correctable application problems."
          
   
   [End of quote from GE tech. note]
   
   This note goes on to list the following as the most common causes of
   application problems wrongly attributed to 'memory':
   
    1. Cutoff voltage too high - basically, since NiCds have such a flat
       voltage vs. discharge characteristic, using voltage sensing to
       determine when the battery is nearly empty can be tricky; an
       improper setting coupled with a slight voltage depression can
       cause many products to call a battery "dead" even when nearly the
       full capacity remains usable (albeit at a slightly reduced
       voltage).
    2. High temperature conditions - NiCds suffer under high-temp
       conditions; such environments reduce both the charge that will be
       accepted by the cells when charging, and the voltage across the
       battery when charged (and the latter, of course, ties back into
       the above problem).
    3. Voltage depression due to long-term overcharge - Self-explanatory.
       NiCds can drop 0.1-0.15 V/cell if exposed to a long-term (i.e., a
       period of months) overcharge. Such an overcharge is not unheard-of
       in consumer gear, esp. if the user gets in the habit of leaving
       the unit in a charger of simplistic design (but which was intended
       to provide enough current for a relatively rapid charge). As a
       precaution, I do NOT leave any of my NiCd gear on a charger longer
       than the recommended time UNLESS the charger is specifically
       designed for long-term "trickle charging", and explicitly
       identified as such by the manufacturer.
    4. There are a number of other possible causes listed in a
       "miscellaneous" category; these include -
          + Operation below 0 deg. C
          + High discharge rates (above 5C) in a battery not specifically
            designed for such use
          + Inadequate charging time or a defective charger
          + One or more defective or worn-out cells (NiCds DO have a
            finite life; they won't keep charging and discharging FOREVER
            no matter how well we baby them.)
       
   
   To close with one more quote from the GE note:
   
   
          "To recap, we can say that true 'memory' is exceedingly rare.
          When we see poor battery performance attributed to 'memory', it
          is almost always certain to be a correctable application
          problem. Of the...problems noted above, Voltage Depression is
          the one most often mistaken for 'memory'.....

3.2) NiCd 'memory' and more

   [...] stated that the "memory" effect was not caused by shallow
   discharges, but by poor charging practices. Well, this is correct in
   that most commerical apps have cheap constant current chargers, and
   people forget to unplug them. However, with the most sophisicated
   chargers, and repetative cycling, a noticable voltage plateau does
   indeed develope, and it occurs at both electrodes. (I have the data)
   The cadmium electrode is said to develope a cadmium/nickel alloy with
   a smaller reversible potential. The positive electrode is more
   complex. The formation of the higher valence Ni+3 (gamma) phase
   material seems to produce marked semicondutor phenonenon, which can
   lead to depletion of the charge carrier (holes?). In this case the
   positive electrode potential can drop down to the reversible potential
   for oxygen. If this happens any oxygen in the cell, it can reconbine
   electrochemcially at the positive, creating a mixed potenital which is
   seen as such a plateau. Both oxygen build up and gamma phase
   acculation are often the result of overcharging, but will happen too
   with "good" charging paractices, but more slowely.
   
   Getting back to the origninal question, is reconditioning useful. The
   answer is definitely a yes, but marginally. If you were to completely
   discharge your cells every time you used them, you would dramtically
   shorten thier lives. If however, you need max capacity and have the $$
   for new cells, go for it. I would recommend a recondition once every
   three months for most applications. Too much hassle? then don't do it
   and buy new packs sooner.
   
   Recondition should be done to 1.0 volts per cell or there abouts, if
   no individual cell let down resistors are present. The strong cells
   tend to drive the weak into reversal, generating hydrogen and causing
   some permanent dammage to the cell, although the hydrogen will
   eventually recombine. Lots of hydrogen is a dangerous thing. If you
   feel must go lower, you should switch to a low rate reistor for the
   last bit. With individual cell monitoring you could go all the way to
   0.0 v theoretically, but that never happens.
   
   But I prefer to run my packs to various depths, and get a mild
   "stealth" reconditioning that way. This reduces the total number of
   cycles on the pack and should help prolong the useful life.
   
   I was stated that with modern Ni-Cd's rigorous battery charge control
   was nearly superfluous. I couldn't disagree more. The trend for
   rechargable applicaions is to push them harder and harder, with
   expectations of greater cycle life, faster recharge, better voltage
   regulation, and more temperature tollerance. The basic commerical
   design has not changed very much, although some manufacturers are
   doing a very good job in tuning thier production to give consistent
   cells. The desire for 15 minute chargers is very real, and you need
   special equipment to do it.
   
   Pulse charing is a hot topic that alot of people are trying stake out
   patents. There seems to be some advantage at the highest rates 15 -30
   minute charging to this technique for nicds. The Cristie charger was
   designed for Lead-Acid systems, where liquid phase stratification was
   a big problem. It is quite helpful in "stirring" the acid in the big
   cells they typically market. There is also some evidence that the
   pulse charging changes the morphology of the cadmium electode, in an
   advantageous way. High rates and current reversals tend to give higher
   areas and better utilization. This is good, expecially for cheap
   plastic roll bonded cadmium electrodes found in your average
   commerical cell.
   
   The comments about storage shorted or trickle charged is right on.
   What wasn't said is the benefits of keeping them in the fridge or
   frezzer. Keep them above -20f and you'll be sure not to freeze the
   electroltye.
   
   Jonathon was asking about bubbles and charging and heat. It sounds
   like you got some sales literature thrown at you. The bubbles are
   oxygen, and you don't shake them loose, you electro- chemcially
   recombine them. Bill, they are generated at the Nickel electrode. The
   real solution is to not make so many of them. You do that by
   controlling the cell potential, and thus the driving potential on the
   positive electrode. Pulsing may do that by relaxing the proton
   diffusion gradients in the postive electrode, or it may not! Like I
   said, at high rates, good idea. The effect on dead cells can be to
   burn out the cadmium shorts and give you a few more cycles. Jon, I
   could tell you what to look for but then I'd have to kill ya! :-)
   
   The circuit that Gerald posted seems to be working off 60 hz AC. I am
   not sure, but I think that is a little fast for optimal results. (So
   move to europe 50 hz :-) The problem is that at two high a frequency
   you just access the doulbe layer capacitance in the cell and you don't
   exercise the main reactions, or the overcharge ones. I seem to
   remember 15 hz as being indicated by the work of McBreen on the Zinc
   electrode.
   
   I could go on, but have probably said to much already. I hope somebody
   finds it useful. If somebody has a specific application or problem, I
   can handle it by email at
