<H3>24 BIT DIGITAL I/O PIO DETAILS</H2>

<H4>PROGRAMMING INFORMATION</H4>

<P>The 8255 I/O <A href="zhelp.htm#PIO">PIO</A> occupies (4) consecutive 8 bit I/O locations starting at BASE+0 and going to BASE+3.</P>

<P>The structure of the addressing is as follows:


<ul>
<li>BASE+0 = Port A (read or write)
<li>BASE+1 = Port B (read or write)
<li>BASE+2 = Port C (read or write)
<li>BASE+3 = Control Register (write only)
</ul></P>

<P>The following is an overview of each of the three available modes:</P>


<P>MODE 0 (Basic Input/Output):



<UL>
<LI>(2) Eight bit ports and (2) 4 bit ports


<LI>Any port can be either input or output


<LI>Outputs are latched


<LI>Inputs are not latched


<LI>(16) different Input/Output configurations are possible in this mode


</UL></P>


<BR><BR>


<P>MODE 1 (Strobed Input/Output):


<UL>


<LI> (2) Groups (Group A and Group B)


<LI> Each group contains one 8 bit data port and (1) 4 bit control/data port


<LI> The 8 bit data port can be either input or output


<LI> Both inputs and outputs are latched


<LI> The 4 bit port is used for control and status of the 8 bit data port


</UL>


</P>


<BR><BR>


<P>MODE 2 ( Strobed Bi-directional Bus I/O):


<UL>
<LI>Used in Group A only


<LI> One 8 bit bi-directional bus port (Port A) and one 5 bit control port (Port C)


<LI> Both inputs and outputs are latched


<LI> The 5 bit control port (Port C) is used for control and status for the 8 bit, bi-directional bus port (Port A)


</UL>

CONTROL WORD to define operation mode: (This word is written to base+3)<p>
<IMG SRC="gfx/z255cont.gif"><pre>
D7 = 1  Designation of mode set flag

D6  D5  Mode selection of Group A
0   0  = mode 0
0   1  = mode 1
1   x  = mode 2

D4  Input/Output selection of Port A
0 = Output
1 = Input

D3  Input/Output selection of high order 4 bits of Port C
0 = Output
1 = Input

D2  Mode selection of Group B
0  = mode 0
1  = mode 1

D1  Input/Output selection of Port B
0 = Output
1 = Input

D0  Input/Output selection of low order 4 bits of Port C
0 = Output
1 = Input
