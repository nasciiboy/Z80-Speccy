Hey another thing you may wish to consider mentioning are the bugs in the NMOS version of the CPU.<br>  One of them is with regard to the buggy

IFF2->parity flag performance in the LD A,I and LD A,R instructions.  <br>
An error can occur when an INTACK runs near these instructions: <br>
the parity flag will be showing 0 when it should have been 1. <br>
A Zilog app. note is around somewhere talking about this.<br> 
It's a rather nasty bug for embeddedaapps...  There are I think a few others.<br>
