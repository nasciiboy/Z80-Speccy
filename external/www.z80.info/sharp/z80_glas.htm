            Abeno-ku, Osaka; Katsuhiko Machida, President; "Sharp" below), and 
            Semiconductor Energy Laboratory Co., Ltd. (headquarters: Atsugi, 
            Kanagawa Prefecture; Shumpei Yamazaki, President; "SEL" below), have 
            successfully integrated an 8-bit Z80<SUP>*1</SUP> CPU onto a glass 
            substrate designed for LCD displays, based on their jointly 
            developed CG- Silicon<SUP>*2</SUP> technology<IMG height=13 
            alt="Mobile Notebook PC<PC-MM1-H1W>Simulated screen image" 
            src="021022-1.gif" width=16>a world 
            first.<BR><BR>CG (Continuous Grain) Silicon technology is the core 
            technology behind <B>System LCDs</B>, next-generation functional 
            devices developed jointly by the two companies in 1998. CG-silicon 
            maintains atomic-level continuity at the crystal grain boundaries, 
            thereby enabling electrons to travel through the semiconductor 
            approximately 600 times faster than conventional amorphous silicon 
            and approximately three times faster than low-temperature 
            polysilicon. This technology allows digital logic, including LCD 
            driver and power supplies, I/O interfaces, and signal processing 
            circuitry, to be integrally formed on the same glass substrate as an 
            LCD display. This achievement is expected to lead to dramatic 
            reductions in component mounting area and the number of external 
            parts, and will also contribute to lighter weights and thinner 
            profiles as well as greater reliability in assembled 
            systems.<BR><BR>Sharp and SEL have now succeeded in forming an 8-bit 
            CPU &lt;Z80&gt; on a glass substrate, a world first. This 
            achievement is based on further improvements in the level of 
            crystallinity of the CG-silicon and the introduction of innovative 
            process technology, and opens up the possibility of integrating on 
            the same glass substrate not only functional peripheral components, 
            particularly LCD display components and LCD driver ICs, but also a 
            wide range of data processing circuit logic, including CPUs, memory, 
            image compression/decompression circuitry, and the like. This new 
            success based on CG-Silicon technology represents the first step on 
            the road toward the development of futuristic ultra-thin "sheet 
            computers" and "sheet TVs."<BR><BR>In October of this year, Sharp 
            launched mass production of System LCDs designed for use in mobile 
            devices such as cellular telephones and PDAs. <BR>Both companies are 
            now forging ahead with technology innovations aimed at developing 
            full-fledged systems-on-a-panel appropriate for the "ubiquitous 
            network" world we live in.<BR><BR>
