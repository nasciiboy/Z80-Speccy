<P>Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3<BR>
128K Integrated Home Computer/Disk System</P>
<P>Following on from the outstanding success of the established ZX range
of computers: the original Spectrum, the Spectrum +, the Spectrum 128
and the new generation Spectrum +2, we now proudly present the ZX
Spectrum +3, a machine that combines the very best features of the
previous Sinclair models with the added convenience of a fast access
floppy disk drive.</P>
<P>The whole is a truly complete computer/disk system which allies
established Sinclair technology with AMSTRAD's expertise in
integration and engineering reliability and flair for producing a 'no
nonsense' all-in-one package.</P>
<H3>Software compatibility</H3>
<P>The +3 may be used with software written for the earlier models in the
ZX Spectrum range. This means that a vast quantity of software of
software already exists for the +3. There are literally thousands of
titles available covering every conceivable application: games
utilities, music, scientific, educational and many many more.</P>
<H3>The BASIC</H3>
<P>The +3 uses a computer language called BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose
Symbolic Instruction Code). BASIC is by far the commonest language for
home computers, and +3 BASIC has been designed to be particularly easy
to learn and use.</P>
<H3>How to read this book</H3>
<P>In order to get the best out of your +3, it is vital that you read all
the relevant information provided in this manual. If you skip various
sections, it is likely that you will come to a grinding halt later on!</P>
<P>Therefore, you should adopt the following reading programme...</P>
<P>Chapter 1 - This chapter shows you how to connect up your +3
system. Note especially the safety warnings regarding the wiring-up
of the mains plug.</P>
<P>Chapter 2 - This chapter describes the switching on of the +3 and
shows you how to tune in your TV to display the computer's signal. You
are then shown how to select an option from the 'opening menu' - and
if you don't know how to do that, you'll not be able to use the +3 at
all! If, however, you do know how to tune-in your TV and select menu
options (perhaps by having previously used a Spectrum 128 or a +2),
then you may skip this chapter.
<P>Chapter 3 - This chapter shows you how to load commercially available
disk software. If you never intend to use such software, then you may
skip this chapter.
<P>Chapter 4 - This chapter shows you how to load commercially available
pre-recorded tape software. If you never intend to use such software,
then you may skip this chapter.
<P>Chapter 5 - This chapter covers the use of the +3's built-in disk
drive (known as drive A:). You may skip this chapter only if you never
intend to use the disk drive during BASIC programming (perhaps having
purchased the +3 solely to load and run commercially available
software (e.g. games)). Note that if you have connected an additional
disk drive (B:) to the +3, then throughout the manual you should take
any general references to 'the disk drive' as meaning both drives (A:
and B:).
<P>Chapter 6 - This chapter introduces you to +3 BASIC. It particular, it
describes the editor and certain aspects of BASIC programming that
differ from those of other computers. Therefore, even if you are an
experienced BASIC programmer on another computer, you should still
read chapter 6. Note that you'll require a blank CF-2 floppy disk as
you work through this chapter. If, however, you never intend to
program in BASIC and have purchased the +3 solely to load and run
commercially available software (e.g. games), then you may skip this
chapter.
<P>Chapter 7 - This is the one chapter that you may freely skip. It
describes the 48 BASIC mode (in which the +3 operates exactly like the
'old-style' Spectrum - even in the editing and programming
aspects). This mode is not recommended as anything other than a
history lesson for the curious, or for loading old (Spectrum 48 only)
tape software. You should certainly not use this mode for BASIC
programming; indeed you cannot access many of the advanced features of
the +3 (including disk drive, extra memory, RS232/MIDI/AUX interfaces
or RAMdisk) from 48 BASIC. Notwithstanding the above, we have provided
the relevant information in this chapter for your reference.
<P>Chapter 8 - This chapter forms the very heart of the manual. It is a
complete guide to BASIC programming on the +3. If you have programmed
in BASIC before, then you may wish to use this chapter merely as a
reference guide, searching the main index to find the information you
need from one of the subsections. If, on the other hand, you are new
to BASIC, you may wish to work through the chapter, one subsection at
a time, developing your programming skills as you go. Once you are
able to type in and run a program, and have grasped a few of the
fundamentals of BASIC, then you may feel confident about skipping
ahead to later subsections. If, however, you never intend to program
in BASIC and have purchased the +3 solely to load and run commercially
available software (e.g. games), then you may skip this chapter.
<P>Chapter 9 - This chapter shows you how to use the +3 as a calculator
only. You may skip this chapter if you wish.
<P>Chapter 10 - This chapter illustrates how add-ons (peripherals) are
connected to the +3. Peripherals include such devices as a cassette
unit, a printer, an additional disk drive, a joystick, etc. So if
you're thinking of linking up any device at all to the +3, check this
chapter to make sure that you've got the right connections. If, on the
other hand, you intend to use just the standard +3 set up
(i.e. computer and TV only), then you may skip this chapter.

<OL>
<LI>Always connect the mains lead of the power supply unit (PSU) to a
3-pin plug following the instructions given in chapter 1.</LI>
<LI>Do not attempt to connect the PSU to any mains supply other than
220-240V AC 50Hz.</LI>
<LI>After you have finished using the +3, always disconnect the PSU
from the mains supply socket.</LI>
<LI>There are no user serviceable parts inside the equipment - DO NOT
ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS INSIDE THE PSU - THERE ARE HIGH VOLTAGES
INSIDE. Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel.</LI>
<LI>Do not block or cover the ventilation slots in the equipment.</LI>
<LI>Do not use or store the equipment in excessively hot, cold, damp,
or dusty areas.</LI>
<LI>Never plug in (or unplug) any device from any of the rear sockets
while the +3 is switched on - doing so will probably damage both the
+3 and the device.</LI>
<LI>Never switch the +3 on or off while a disk is inserted in the disk
drive. Doing so may corrupt your disk, losing valuable programs or
data.</LI>
<LI>After you have switched off your TV (or VDU monitor), do not
immediately disconnect the +3 - wait a few seconds or so.</LI>
<LI>Do not switch off the +3 (or switch on or off any peripheral
device connected to the +3) while there is a program or data in the
memory that you wish to keep - doing so may make the +3 'crash',
losing the program or data.</LI>
<LI>Always keep the disk drive and disks away from magnetic fields.
For maximum data reliability, do not position the disk drive close to
your TV or monitor, or close to any source of electrical interference.</LI>
<LI>If you have connected an additional disk drive to the +3, keep the
ribbon cable (to the additional drive) away from mains leads.</LI>
<LI>Whenever possible, make back-up (duplicate) copies of disks which
contain valuable programs. Otherwise, should you accidentally lose or
corrupt the disk, replacing may prove very expensive.</LI>
<LI>Never touch the floppy disk surface itself inside its protective
casing.</LI>
<LI>Do not eject a disk while it is being read from or written to.</LI>
<LI>Always remember that formatting a disk will erase its previous
contents.</LI>
