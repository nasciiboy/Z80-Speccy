	Reports and messages
	CONTINUE

Reports appear at the bottom of the screen whenever the +3 has stopped
executing some BASIC. They explain why it has stopped - be it for some
natural reason, or because an error has occurred.

Most reports have a code number or letter (so that you can refer to
the table ahead), a brief message explaining what happened, and the
line number (and the statement number within the line) where BASIC
stopped. (A command is shown as line '0'. Within a line, statement '1'
is at the beginning, statement '2' comes after the first colon (or
THEN), and so on.)

Reports pertaining to disk operation (or +3DOS) do not start with a
number or letter - they are shown ahead in alphabetical order.

The behaviour of the CONTINUE command depends very much on the
reports. Normally, CONTINUE goes to the line and statement specified
in the last report, but there are exceptions with reports '0', '9' and
'D'.

Here is a table showing all the reports. The right-hand column tells
you in which circumstances the report can occur, and this refers you
to part 31 of this chapter. For example, you can see from the table
that the error 'A Invalid argument' can occur with SQR, LN, ACS, ASN
and USR. If you then look up these keywords in part 31 of this
chapter, you will be able to find out just which arguments are
invalid.

Disk errors marked by 'RIC' (in the left-hand column) will normally be
displayed followed by the options: '- Retry, Ignore or Cancel?'. If
the cancel option is chosen, then the report shown in the second
column will be displayed.

|     | Successful completion, or jump to a line number  |                    |
|     | bigger than any existing. This report does not   |                    |
|     | change the line and statement jumped to by       |                    |
|     | CONTINUE.                                        |                    |
|     |                                                  |                    |
| 1   | NEXT without FOR                                 | NEXT               |
|     | The control variable does not exist (it has not  |                    |
|     | been set up by a FOR statement), but there is an |                    |
|     | ordinary variable with the same name.            |                    |
|     |                                                  |                    |
| 2   | Variable not found                               | Any                |
|     | For a simple variable, this will happen if the   |                    |
|     | variable is used before it has been assigned to  |                    |
|     | by a LET, READ or INPUT statement, loaded from   |                    |
|     | disk (or tape), or set up in a FOR statement.    |                    |
|     | For a subscripted variable, it will happen if    |                    |
|     | the variable is used before it has been          |                    |
|     | dimensioned in a DIM statement, or loaded from   |                    |
|     | disk (or tape).                                  |                    |
|     |                                                  |                    |
| 3   | Subscript wrong                                  | Subscripted        |
|     | A subscript is beyond the dimension of the array | variables,         |
|     | or there are the wrong number of subscripts. If  | Substrings         |
|     | the subscript is negative or bigger than 65535,  |                    |
|     | then error 'B' will result.                      |                    |
|     |                                                  |                    |
| 4   | Out of memory                                    | LET, INPUT,        |
|     | There is not enough room in the computer for     | FOR, DIM,          |
|     | what you are trying to do. If the computer       | GO SUB,            |
|     | really seems to be stuck in this state, you may  | LOAD, MERGE,       |
|     | have to clear out the command line using DELETE  | Sometimes          |
|     | and then delete a program line or two (with the  | during             |
|     | intention of putting them back afterwards) to    | expression         |

| 5   | Out of screen                                    | INPUT,             |
|     | An INPUT statement has tried to generate more    | PRINT AT           |
|     | than 23 lines in the lower half of the screen.   |                    |
|     | Also occurs with 'PRINT AT 22,xx'.               |                    |

|     | Calculations have yielded a number greater than  | arithmetic         |
|     | approximately 10^38.                             |                    |

|     | There has been one more RETURN than there were   |                    |

|     | After this, CONTINUE will not repeat the STOP,   |                    |
|     | but carries on with the statement after.         |                    |
