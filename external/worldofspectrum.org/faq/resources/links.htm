<p><strong><a id="Projects">Development Projects:</a></strong><br />
The Sinclair development community is very active, with many upgraded and expanded versions of the original software and firmware
having been produced. Full ROM disassemblies have been produced, allowing you to creative control of how your original hardware or
emulator behaves. The following represtents a small selection of completed or ongoing development projects - you will find details of
many more related projects by following links from these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/index.html">+3e ROM</a> v1.11<br />
<a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3d4d2c1c1caecdfd2ddd0d2c0c7d6c1f3cad2dbdcdc9dd0dc9dc6d89dc1d6dedcc5d69dc7dbdac0">Garry Lancaster</a> has developed a replacement ROM for use with the
ZX Spectrum +3 or (black) ZX Spectrum +2A. Many enhancements are included, including BASIC extensions for managing hard disks, support for partition
sizes of up to 16Mb (via a suitable IDE Interface - diagrams are available to download), direct access to <a href="../reference/z80format.htm">.z80</a>
snapshot files, and an improved editor. The ROMs can be dowloaded for use with many common <a title="Emulators" href="../emulators/emulators.htm">emulators</a>
or purchased as ready-made replacements for your original ROMs. Both the ROM and site are available in
<a href="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/index.html">English</a> and <a href="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/espanol/index.html">Spanish</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/sinclairbasic/">SE Basic</a> v0.80a<br />
The aim of the SE Basic Project is to create a universal Open Source update to Sinclair Basic to fix the bugs, improve the editor, and resolve hardware conflicts
between various versions of the ZX Spectrum, while maintaining compatibility with the majority of Spectrum software and allowing for platform independence.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wearmouth.demon.co.uk/">SEA Change ROM</a><br />
An adaptation of the original ZX Spectrum ROM, this version offers many enhancements and bug-fixes. Also available at this site are complete
assembly listings (with very detailed comments) for many original Sinclair ROM files. The SEA Change ROM was written by
<a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f196949e9797b1869490839c9e848599df95949c9e9fdf929edf849adf83949c9e8794df85999882">Geoff Wearmouth</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://zxvgs.yarek.com/">ZXVGS Operating System</a> v0.31<br />
Designed and developed by <a href="http://www.yarek.com/">Jarek Adamski</a>, this replacement Operating System

</ul>

<p><strong><a id="Hardware">Hardware Projects:</a></strong><br />
Many people still produce hardware expansions and countless more describe the various modifications that can be performed on original Sinclair
hardware (at your own risk!) Please see the following sites for details of these projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.petersplus.com/">Peters Plus</a> (Sprinter)<br />
The Sprinter is a modern system, built around the Zilog Z84C15 CPU and the Altera PLD. The design allows for multiple systems to
be simulated, including the ZX Spectrum. Several different system configurations can be enabled directly, with user-defined configurations
also being available if required.<br /><br />
The Sprinter is available as a complete system with case, etc. or as a board that can be fitted to your own
case. For a full review of the Sprinter, and an interview with the designers, please read the second issue of
<a href="../essential.htm#magazines">ZXF</a> magazine. Several forums, introductory, FAQ and reference
documents are available from the Peters Plus
<a href="http://www.petersplus.com/">web site</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://zxse.raww.net/index2.html">ZX Spectrum SE</a><br />
Based on a design by <a title="Contributors" href="../credits.htm">Andrew Owen</a>, this is a full replacement for the original ZX Spectrum, initially designed around
<a href="../reference/hardware.htm#TC2048">Timex TC2048</a> hardware, and fully compatible with the
<a href="http://zxvgs.yarek.com/">ZXVGS Operating System</a>. <a href="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/residos/">ResiDOS</a>, by Garry
Lancaster can also be used - future versions of this system will support this natively. Although based on the Timex TC2048, any Spectrum hardware can
be adapted to a ZX Spectrum SE - contact <a href="http://www.yarek.com/">Jarek Adamski</a> for details.<br /><br /></li>
