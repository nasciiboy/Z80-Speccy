<p><strong><a id="Archives">Archives:</a></strong><br />Almost all known Spectrum software is available online from several large archive sites. There are still
thousands of 'lost' or incomplete titles, however - please check the <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/stp">STP</a> Spectrum Tape Preservation),
<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/sdp">SDP</a> (Spectrum Disk Preservation),
<a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/instructions.html">Spectrum Instructions Project</a> and
<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/mia.html">MIA</a> (Missing in Action) pages to see if you can help recover these.
Many more software sites are listed on the <a href="resources/links.htm#Games">links</a> page.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">World of Spectrum</a><br />
Maintained by Martijn van der Heide, the World of Spectrum was established in 1995 quickly became the premier site for the general Sinclair
community. WoS contains more Spectrum software than any other site, and has a strict policy of distributing only those titles that are legally
distributable. An enormous amount of technical information, documentation, inlay scans, game maps, and virtually every emulator ever
released can be found at WoS. Recently, several Web Forums have been added and are very active. WoS is affiliated with many other 'key'
sites, and is host to many current software preservation and Spectrum development projects. See the
<a href="resources/ftp.htm">FTP Sites</a> page for a list of current WoS mirrors.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://tzxvault.retrogames.com/">The .TZX Vault</a><br />
Maintained by Steve Brown. Aims to preserve as much original Spectrum (and Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 &amp; VIC-20) software
as possible as original tape or disk images (see <a href="reference/formats.htm#TZX">.tzx</a> and
<a href="reference/formats.htm#DSK">.dsk</a> for specifications) These files can be used to re-create the original software on tape or
disk for use on real machines, or one of the many <a title="Emulators" href="emulators/emulators.htm">emulators</a> that support these formats.
An <a href="ftp://darenp.co.uk">FTP mirror</a> of the .TZX Vault is maintained by Daren Pearcy.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.speccy.org/spa2/">SPA2</a><br />
With similar goals as the TZX Vault (see below), the Spanish Spectrum Archive aims to make every Spectrum program
released in Spain available online as a perfect tape/disk image. Titles are listed with any instructions and inlay cards available, and can be
viewed by year of release, publisher, genre or title. Available in <a href="http://www.speccy.org/spa2/english/index.htm">English</a>
