<p>The original ZX Spectrum was introduced before floppy disk drives were a realistically affordable option for most
home users. Within a few years, however, prices had fallen to such an extent that a large number of disk interfaces
and drives were available that could be readily, and inexpensively, purchased by the 'average' user.<br /><br />
In the intervening period, a number of alternative systems were developed, including the Rotronics Wafadrive and ZX
Microdrive. These systems are 'hybrid' designs, being based on endless-loop cassettes. These systems proved very
popular, and offered high capacity storage with much greater reliability and speed than normal cassettes, without
costing substantially more in media terms.<br /><br />
The drives listed below represent a small number of those available.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong><a id="ZX">ZX Spectrum +3 Disk Drive</a></strong><br />
The disk drive on the +3 is controlled by three ports:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>0x1ffd: Setting bit 3 high will turn the drive motor (or motors, if you have more than one drive attached) on. Setting bit 3 low will
turn them off again. (0x1ffd is also used for <a href="128kreference.htm#Plus3Memory">memory control</a>).</li>
<li>0x2ffd: Reading from this port will return the main status register of the uPD765A (the FDC used in the +3).</li>
<li>0x3ffd: Bytes written to this port are sent to the FDC, whilst reading from this port will read bytes from the FDC.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
For more information on the uPD765A, see the CPC Guide section at the <a href="http://andercheran.aiind.upv.es/~amstrad/">
Unofficial Amstrad WWW Resource</a>, as the Amstrad CPCs used the same FDC; the documents most relevant to the +3 are the first
two in the 'Disks' section.<br /><br />
In addition, it is possible to add an Amiga 3.5" drive to a Spectrum +3 by simply wiring the pins
by name and providing it with an external power source (which can be an Amiga PSU with increased amperage, used to
power the entire +3 and external drive) There is a public domain formatter around to format it to 720k - this is
quite useful as 3" disks are now a rarity and were never that reliable.<br /><br /></li>


<li><strong><a id="TMX">Timex Disk Drives</a></strong><br />
There are two versions of the disk system created by Timex Portugal, the FDD and the FDD-3000. Both require a machine
specific interface. These were sold for the TS2068, TC2068 and TC2048 machines but third parties have subsequently
supplied interfaces which work with the 128K ZX Spectrum (these are also required for the TC2128 and TC2144).<br /><br />
Both systems have their own <a href="z80reference.htm">Z80</a> CPU but while the FDD only has 16K of RAM,
the FDD 3000 has 64K and can be used as a CP/M terminal. The FDD consists of three separate boxes while the FDD-3000
integrates a PSU and two 3" drives. It is possible, although tricky, to upgrade an FDD to an FDD-3000. Both systems can use
3.5" and 5.25" drives in place of (or in addition to) the 3" drives.<br /><br />
The interface uses a logic circuit to page in the 4KB FDD ROM whenever there is a call to 0x0000 or 0x0008 and page it out again whenever
there is a call to 0x0604. When it is needed the FDD ROM is paged in at 0x0000 and 0x1000 and the area 0x2000-0x3fff holds eight copies of 1K
of RAM or four copies of 2K of RAM. The disk drive is controlled by port 0xef.<br /><br /></li>


<li><strong><a id="Discovery">Opus Discovery</a></strong><br />
The Opus Discovery provides several different expansions in a single unit, featuring a Joystick port, pass-through expansion
connector, parallel printer port, a composite video/monitor output and a single 3.5in disk drive that supports disks of up to
250K in capacity (178K when formatted).<br /><br />
An upgraded model, the Discovery 2, was also introduced that featured 2 drives. The Discovery 1 could be upgraded to the
Discovery 2 by returning the system to the manufacturer. The power supply for the Opus replaces the original Sinclair model,
and is used to power both the interface and the computer.<br /><br />
Operationally quite similar to the Microdrive (albeit with disks), the same commands are supported by both the Discovery
and ZX Interface I - this reduces the 'learning-curve' quite dramatically and allows many programs with ZX Interface I &amp; Microdrive
support to be easily adapted or use without difficulty. The ZX Microdrive is faster, however.<br /><br />

<li><a href="../resources/documents.htm#Peripherals">Opus Discovery Block Diagram</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><br />
The Discovery 1 cost &pound;199.95 when originally introduced and the Discovery 2 cost &pound;329.95. The upgrade from Discovery 1
to Discovery 2 (known as the Discovery Plus) cost &pound;139.95. Emulation of the Opus Discovery is provided by
<a href="../emulators/msdos.htm">RealSpec</a> for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems.<br /><br /></li>


<li><strong><a id="Crescent">Crescent Quick Disk</a></strong><br />
Three different versions of the Crescent Quick Disk were introduced; the 128, 128i and 256i. The 128 was intended as an
add-on drive for existing systems and was not supplied with a disk interface. The 128i includes the required interface, with
the 256i being a high-capacity version of the 128i. Storage capacities are as the names imply, and each system included an RGB
socket and RS-423 interface, and are compatible with either the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum +.<br /><br />
The Crescent 128 cost &pound;99.95 when introduced, with the 128i and 256i costing &pound;129.95 and &pound;229.90
respectively.<br /><br /></li>





<li><strong><a id="Lifetime">MGT Lifetime Disc Drive</a></strong><br />
Please refer to the <a href="http://www.envytech.co.uk/mgt/">MGT Lifetime FAQ</a>, developed by Damien Guard,
for full technical details of this device.<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.envytech.co.uk/mgt/#documentation">MGT Lifetime User Manual</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><br />
The FAQ is very comprehensive, with sections detailing how to configure this drive for use with many different types of system.<br /><br /></li>


<li><strong><a id="Triton">Triton Quick Disk</a></strong><br />
The Triton Quick Disk system, produced by Radofin Electronics (who also distributed the Mattel Aquarius), allowed up
to 100K of data to be saved on double-sided 2.8" disks (50K each side). Data is recorded in a 'spiral' pattern, rather than
in concentric circles. Compatible with the original ZX Spectrum and ZX Spectrum + systems (and others).<br /><br />
Up to 2 drives can be connected together (multiple interfaces are required), and the drive features a pass-through
connector that allows a ZX Printer to be connected if desired.<br /><br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Data transmission rate</strong>: 101.6K Bits per second.</li>
<li><strong>Density</strong>: 4410 BPI.</li>
<li><strong>Disk type</strong>: 2.8" double-sided.</li>
<li><strong>Disk capacity</strong>: Up to 100K, 20 sectors per side, 2.5k per sector.</li></ul><br />
Although marketed as a floppy-disk drive, the Triton Quick Disk can more accurately categorised as a 'stringly-floppy'-style system,
like the ZX Microdrive and Rotronics Wafadrives, since 'disk' access is sequential rather than random. The maximum seek-time is
approximately 8 seconds. The Triton Quick Disk originally cost &pound;119.95.<br /><br /></li>


<li><strong><a id="Pacer">Omnitronix Pacer</a></strong><br />
The Omnitronix Pacer system comprises several different parts, each of which could be purchased separately for use with
compatible products. The disk interface connects to either a ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum + via a short ribbon cable attached
to the edge connector, and supports 5.25", 3.5" and 3" disk drives.<br /><br />
A complete system could be purchased that included the interface and a 5.25" disk drive, offereing up to 100K of storage on single-sided,
40 track disks. An enhanced system that included the interface and a 400K capacity 5.25" double-sided 40/80 track disk drive was also available.<br /><br />
The disk interface cost &pound;79.95, with the complete systems costing &pound;119.95 and &pound;189.95 respectively.<br /><br /></li>
