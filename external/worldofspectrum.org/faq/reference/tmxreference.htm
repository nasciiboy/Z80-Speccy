<p>This section, which you may want to read in conjunction with the <a href="../resources/documents.htm#Reference">Timex TS2068 Technical Manual</a>,
discusses the three (official) Timex machines that closely resemble the ZX Spectrum; the TS2068, TC2068
and TC2048. Timex produced a number of other machines (the <a href="hardware.htm#TS1000">TS1000</a>,
<a href="hardware.htm#TS1500">TS1500</a>, etc.) which are closely related to the
<a href="hardware.htm#ZX81">ZX81</a> - additional information about these can found in various sites listed in the '<a title="Links" href="../resources/links.htm">links</a>' and
'<a href="hardware.htm">hardware</a>' sections of this document. In addition, several variants or clones of
these machines were produced (often unofficially) - unless particularly noteworthy, these machines are not covered in
detail here. A
<a href="BASICReference.htm#Timex">Timex Basic</a> reference is also available.</p>
<p><strong>The Timex Machines:</strong><br />
The TS2068, the TC2068 and the TC2048 each share the same basic internal design, described immediately below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TS2068 is an American machine operating at 60Hz on a 110v power supply and generates an NTSC television picture
(just like the Spectrums sold by mail order in the US by Sinclair) but with a TS1000 (ZX81) compatible expansion bus.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The TC2068 is the European version operating at 50Hz on a 230-240v power supply and generates a PAL
television signal (used throughout Europe, except in France where SECAM is used instead) with a normal expansion bus.
Both machines feature an <a href="pinouts.htm#AY">AY-3-8912</a> sound chip (not 128 compatible), an
extended version of BASIC in 24K of ROM (semi-compatible), two non-standard joystick ports, a cartridge dock
(not IF2 compatible), and a new ULA with extra video modes, but some incompatiblities. There is also a Polish clone of the
TC2068, called the UK2086, which substitutes an RS232 port for one of the joystick ports.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The TC2048 is a TC2068 with all the extra hardware removed, except the new ULA, but a normal BASIC ROM (only slightly
modified), a BNC composite out (but no RGB signals on the bus), and a Kempston joystick port (but no +5v as needed by
autofire joysticks).</li>
</ul>
There are also two modified versions of the TC2048; the TC2128 (Rebuiltion or similar) and the TC2144
(by <a href="http://www.yarek.com/">Jarek Adamski</a>). The TC2128 extends the TC2048 to 128K using the
Spectrum 128 memory scheme. The TC2144 does the same but provides an extra 16K of memory between 0x8000 and 0xc000. Both
upgrades allow the ULA to use the shadow screen in Bank 7 giving the machine a total of four screen areas.<br /><br />
Although the Timex machines are similar to the 48K machine there are some timing differences:
<ul>
<li>The main processor runs at 3.52800 MHz, as opposed to 3.50000 MHz on the 48K Spectrum.</li>
<li>The <a href="pinouts.htm#AY">AY-3-8912</a> sound chip runs at 1.76475 Mhz.</li>
<li>The American machines have a 60 Hz interrupt as opposed to 50 Hz on the European machines.</li>
<li>The scanline timings are probably different.</li>
</ul>
There are 224 T-states on a normal 48K Spectrum, 312 scanlines per frame and 64 scanlines before the television picture.
Theoretically, on the European models there should be 226 T-states per scanline. There are either 311 or 312 scanlines per frame and 63
or 64 scanlines before the television picture, but this has not been accurately tested. This means that there are probably somewhere between
70286 and 70512 T states per frame. At a guess, on European models the '50 Hz' interrupt occurs at 50.04 Hz. It is not known at precisely what
point the '60 Hz' interrupt occurs on American models. The Spectrum's ULA bug which causes snow when I is set to point to
<a href="48kreference.htm#Contention">conteded memory</a> is not present as the Timex machines use a different ULA.

<ul>
<li><strong><a id="SCRModes">Screen Modes</a></strong><br />
The ULA used by the Timex machines provides a number of additional screen modes.
These are controlled using Port 0xff. An unfortunate side effect of this is that a few games, like Arkanoid, which expect reading 0xff to
produce screen and ATTR data bytes when the ULA is reading the screen memory, will not work, since reading 0xff on the Timex returns
the last byte sent to the port. It is not known if this port is fully decoded but it seems likely that it is partially decoded, as on the Spectrum.
Port 0xff is also used to enable/disable the timer interrupt and select which bank of memory to use for the horizontal MMU. The byte to
output will be interpreted thus:
<pre>  Bits 0-2: Screen mode. 000=screen 0, 001=screen 1, 010=hi-colour, 110=hi-res
  Bits 3-5: Sets the screen colour in hi-res mode.
              000 - Black on White     100 - Green on Magenta
              001 - Blue on Yellow     101 - Cyan on Red
              010 - Red on Cyan        110 - Yellow on Blue
              011 - Magenta on Green   111 - White on Black
  Bit 6:    If set disables the generation of the timer interrupt.
  Bit 7:    Selects which bank the horizontal MMU should use. 0=DOCK, 1=EX-ROM.</pre>
Screen 0 is the normal screen at 0x4000. Screen 1 uses the same format but at 0x6000.<br /><br />
The hi-colour screen uses the data area of screen 0 and screen 1 to create a 512x192 pixel screen. Columns are taken alternately from
screen 0 and screen 1. The attribute area is not used. In this mode all colurs, including the BORDER, are BRIGHT, and the BORDER colour
is the same as the PAPER colour.<br /><br />
The multi-colour screen uses the data area of screen 0 for its data and the data area of screen 1 for its attributes, giving 2 colours per 8x1
pixel block. The attribute area is in the same byte order as the data area, which means MLT files, which have the attribute are in series, must
be converted to be displayed.<br /><br />
Bit 6 is the hardware equivalent of issuing a DI (disable interrupts) instruction in machine code, and is unaffected by the instruction EI
(enable interrupts), so should be used with caution. Bit 6 can be useful for getting ROM routines which normally enable interrupts to
run slightly faster.<br /><br />
With careful timing it is possible to mix screen modes so you could have a screen where the top half is hi-colour and the bottom half is
hi-res - perfect for text adventures with graphics. Using a similar technique it is also possible to have more than two colours on a hi-res
screen. However, it is believed that no commercial software ever actually did this.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong><a id="Memory">Memory</a></strong><br />
The Timex machines feature a horizontal memory management unit. In the TS2068 and TC2048 it is used to support
the extended BASIC and cartridges plugged into the dock. It is present in the TC2048 but there is no direct way
to connect anything to it (although the refresh signals are available to connect an additional 128K of RAM to the horizontal MMU).<br /><br />
The memory map of these computers is:
<pre>         EX-ROM      HOME       DOCK
0xffff +----------+----------+----------+
       |  Bank 7' | 32K RAM  |  Bank 7  |
       |          |          |          |
0xe000 +----------+          +----------+
       |  Bank 6' |          |  Bank 6  |
       |          |          |          |    
0xc000 +----------+          +----------+
       |  Bank 5' |          |  Bank 5  |
       |          |          |          |
0xa000 +----------+          +----------+
       |  Bank 4' |          |  Bank 4  |
       |          |          |          |
0x8000 +----------+----------+----------+
       |  Bank 3' | Screen 1 |  Bank 3  |
       |          |          |          |
0x6000 +----------+----------+----------+
       |  Bank 2' | Screen 0 |  Bank 2  |
       |          |          |          |
0x4000 +----------+----------+----------+
       |  Bank 1' | 16K ROM  |  Bank 1  |
       |          |          |          |
0x2000 +----------+          +----------+
       |  Bank 0' |          |  Bank 0  | 
       |          |          |          | 
0x0000 +----------+----------+----------+</pre>
Memory is paged in 8K banks from either the DOCK or the EX-ROM, but these banks are mutually exclusive - you cannot page in a bank
from both simultaneously. Bit 7 of port 0xff determines which bank to use (0=DOCK, 1=EX-ROM). Port 0xf4 determines which banks are to
be paged in with each bit referring to the relevant bank (0-7 or 0'-7'). When memory is being paged, interrupts should be disabled and the
stack should be in an area which is not going to change.<br /><br />
The HOME bank is the normal Spectrum memory area. The top 32K is uncontended but the 16K screen area below that is contended. Banks
are overlaid on this bank, but paging over the screen area does not change the RAM used by the ULA. This does mean it is possible to set up
a screen and page it out.<br /><br />
On a TC2048, BASIC is contained in the 16K ROM area and banks 0-7 and 0'-7' are not normally available, while on a TS2068 or a TC2068
part of the BASIC is stored in an 8K ROM in bank 0' and cartridges plugged into the dock use banks 0-7.<br /><br />
The contended memory timings for these machines are unknown but should be similar to that for the 48K machine, except that the pattern
starts at a different number of T-states after the interrupt, than the usual 14344.<br /><br />
Reading this port returns the last byte sent to it.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong><a id="Sound">Sound Chip</a></strong><br />The AY-3-8912 used in the TS2068 and TC2068 is controlled by two I/O ports:
<pre>  OUT (0xf5) - Select a register 0-14
  IN  (0xf6) - Read the value of the selected register
  OUT (0xf6) - Write to the selected register</pre>
IN 0xf5 always returns 255.<br /><br />
Most Spectrum software written to use the AY chip expects to find it at the addresses used by the Spectrum 128.<br /><br />
Typically, the <a href="pinouts.htm#AY">AY</a> chip is written to inside 128K games using:
<pre>  LD BC,0xfffd     01 FD FF
  OUT (C),D        ED 51
  LD B,0xbf        06 BF
  OUT (C),E        ED 59</pre>
To convert to a TS2068 or TC2068 poke a few values as follows:
<pre>  LD BC,0xfff5     01 F5 FF
  OUT (C),D        ED 51
  LD C,0xf6        0E F6
  OUT (C),E        ED 59</pre>
If you've got a Fuller box, you can do the same mod, replacing F5 with 3F and F6 with 5F.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the 128K ZX Spectrum 128, <a href="pinouts.htm#AY">AY</a> chip is used
to control MIDI and RS232 but on the TS2068 and TC2068 it is used to read the Timex joysticks instead, using register R14. See the <a href="peripherals.htm#Joysticks">Joystick Interfaces</a> section for technical details.</p></li>
