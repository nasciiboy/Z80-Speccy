The results of these operations are left in the accumulator (A register).  
The carry flag is reset in all logical operations.  The Z, P, and S flags 
are affected.  The first table in the example is a chart of how the 
operation works.  The second is a sample problem with the result.  The 
third is an example mnemonic (s is and 8 bit register).

AND compares two bytes bit by bit.  If a bit is set in both operands, 
it is set to 1 in the result.  Otherwise the bit is reset to 0 in the result.

OR operator compares two bytes bit by bit.  If a bit is in either operand, 
it is set in the result.  Otherwise it is reset in the result.

XOR (exclusive OR) operator comares the two bytes bit by bit.  If the 
bit is set in either operand, but not in both, it is set in th
