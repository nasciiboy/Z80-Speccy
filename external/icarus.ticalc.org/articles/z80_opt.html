This is a short list which covers a few facts how you can make your programs go faster / use less memory. The first list is copied and edited from a book, its tips are mainly for speed, below you'll find my tips, which also deal with the size of programs.<P>


In general, programs can be made to run substantially faster only by first determining where they spend
their time. This requieres determining which loops (other than delay routines) the processor is executing 
most often. Reducing the execution time of a frequently executed loop will have a major effect because of the
multiplying factor. It is thus critical to determine how often instructions are being executed and to 
work on loops in the order of their frequency of execution.<BR>
Once it is determined which loops the processor executes most frequently, reduce their execution time 
with the following techniques:<P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Eliminate redundant operations. These may include a constant that is being added during each iteration
or a special case that is being tested repatedly. Another example is a constant value or a memory address
that is being fetched from memory each time rather than being stored in a register or register pair.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Reorganize the loop to reduce the number of jump instructions. You can often eliminate branches by
changing the initial conditions, inverting the order of operations, or combining operations. In particular,
 you may find it helpful to initialize everything one step back, thus making the first iteration the same as
all the others. Inverting the order of operations can be helpful if numerical comparisons are involved, since
the equality case may not have to be handled sparately. Reorganization may also combine condition checking
 inside the loop with the overall loop control.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> If you call a function only once, use inline code rather than a function. This will save a CALL and a RET. Also make very small function rather macros than normal functions.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Try to take maximum advantage of specialized instructions as <I>LD HL, (ADDR); LD (ADDR), HL; EX DE,HL; EX HL,(SP); DJNZ;</I> and the block move/compare instructions by organizing the registers in the right way.
Thus it is preferable to always use <I>B</I> or <I>BC</I> for a counter, <I>HL</I> for an indirect address, and <I>DE</I> for another indirect address if needed.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Use the block move, block compare, and <I>block I/O instructions</I> to handle blocks of data. These instructions can replace an entire program sequence, since they comibne counting and updating of pointers with the actual data
 manipulation or transfer operations and updating of pointers with the actual data manipulation or transfer operations. Note, in particular, that the block move and block<I>I/O</I> instructions transfer data to or form memory
without using the accumzlator.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Use the 16-bit instructions whenever possible to manipulate 16-bit data. These instructions are <I>ADC, ADD, DEC, EX INC, LD, POP, PUSH, and SBC.</I>
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Use instructions that operate directly on data in user registers or in memory to avoid having to save and restore the accumulator,<I>HL</I>, or an index register. These instructions
inculde <I>DEC, EX, INC, LD, POP, PUSH, and the bit manipulation and shift instructions.</I>
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Minimize the use of the index registers, since they always require extra execution time and memory. The index registers are generally used only as backups to <I>HL</I> and in handlingdata structurs that
involve many fixed offsets.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Minimize the use of special Z80 instructions that require a 2-byte operation code. These alway reequire extra execution time and memory. Examples are <I>BIT, RES, SET, SLA, SRA</I>, and <I>SRL</I>, as well
as some load instructions such as <I>LD DE,(ADDR),LD(ADDR), BC</I> and <I>LD SP,(ADDR)</I>.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Take advantage of specialized short instructions such as the accumulator shifts<I>(RLA, RLCA, RRA, and RRCA)</I> and <I>DJNZ</I>.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Use absolute jumps(<I>JP</I>) rather than relative jumps(<I>JR</I>). The absolute jumps take less time if a branch actually occurs.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Organize sequences of conditional jumps to minimize average execution time. Branches that are often taken should come before ones that are seldom, taken for example, checking for a result being negative
(true 50% of the time if the value is random) before checking for it to be zero(true less than1% of the time if the value is random).
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Test for conditions under which a sequence has no effect and branch around it if the conditions hold. This will be profitable if the sequence is long, and it frequently does not change the result.
A typical example is the propagation of carries through higher or bytes. If a carry seldom occurs, it will be faster on the average to test for it rather than simply propagate a0.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> A general way to reduce execution time is to replace long sequences of instructions with tables. A single table lookup can perform the same operation as a sequence of instructions if there
are no special exits or program logic involved. The cost is extra memory, but that may be justified if the memory is available. If enough memory is avaiable, a lookup table may be reasonable approach even if many of its entries are repetitive- that is, even if many inputs procude the same   output. In
addition to its speed, table lookup is also general, easy to program, and easy to change.

Now for the even more practical approach :-) Here are Andi's tips (a bit more TI85 specific):
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> The less bytes an instruction uses, the faster it generally executes. So always look for a better way to do things. Note however that this might go in hand with some disadvantages... Here are some examples:

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Try, if possible, to use the shadow registers in frequently used loops. You can reach this over the instructions <I>EXX</I> and <I>EX AF',AF</I>. Note however to do a <I>DI</I> to disable interrupts before the actual function and an <I>EI</I> afterwards. Avoid having interrupts switched off all the time.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Pass arguments to function over registers, NOT by PUSHing/POPing or even variables in memory!!
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Keep often used variables, like position of the main character in registers (optimally in those registers you have to pass to the draw function as coordinates)
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Avoid excessive mode switching using the IY register. Each switching costs 4 bytes!
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Take advantage of ROM functions / built-in functions as often as possible. This won't only save you from coding them, they also save storage and are likely to be highly optimized.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> Try to omit using single pixel routines (like FIND_PIXEL on the TI85) too often. For instance, if drawing a sprite, directly access the video memory.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> If possible, use self-modifying code (only possible when code is in RAM) for less code and faster execution.
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> This one courtesy of John Garner: In certain circumstances (where you can disable all interrupts and don't have too make any calls or other use of the stack), an extremely quick way of retrieving data from
memory is to set the stack pointer SP to the start of the memory and then POP bytes into a register pair. The POP takes 10 T-states but it gets 2 bytes at once, and it's twice as quick as a LD HL,(nnn) and works
especially well in reading contiguous buffer data. It's 4 times faster than using LD HL,(...) and then you need to update the load address. 
<LI><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2> This of course also works with PUSHing to store data :)
