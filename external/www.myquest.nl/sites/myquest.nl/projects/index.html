-	Gebruik bestanden op je PC hardeschijf direct op je MSX<br>
-	Lees alle media die je pc kan lezen direct op je MSX; bijvoorbeeld: USB pendrives, CD’s, Compactflash kaarten of netwerkdrives.
(dit alles uiteraard met behulp van een aangesloten PC.)<br>

Je kunt je inschrijven voor een USB-interface; bij voldoende inschrijvingen zal de USB-interface geproduceerd worden. <br>
De richtprijs is (onder voorbehoud) ongeveer 50 euro.<br>

<H1>The Undocumented Z80 Documented</H1>This document was originally written by 
Sean Young but as of February 2005 I've been maintaining it. It strives to 
describe every documented and (officially/previously) undocumented features of 
the Zilog Z80 CPU, as found in MSX computers (and many others).

<H1>Nowind MSX Emulator</H1>

You've probably never heard of this emulator because, it was our (and Sargon's) best
kept secret :) It's a relatively new MSX Emutalor that started in Oktober 2003 when we (Aaldert Dekker and Jan Wilmans)
were on our annual windsurfing trip and had no wind. We designed an MSX emulator on paper back then, but soon afterwards
it became reality. And now it's a full-featured MSX2 Emulator. Why a new emulator? Just to see if we could do it :)
So what is special about this emulator, is it "better" than others? Probably not, it's special though because we implemented
each part from scratch (z80, vdp, psg, scc, no borrowed code anywhere) and it is in portable C++. It's based on 
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> and so it runs on any platform supported by SDL, which includes WindowsXP, Linux, Bsd,
Solaris/SunOs and MacOsX.

There was never en probably never will be an actual release of the emulator, we 
are currently using it to develop our Nowind diskrom and drivers. We also intend to share our knowlegde and
possibly help implement <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cbios/"> C-Bios DISKROM </A>.

6 December, 2008! An update: the above text was probably nearing 5 year of age :) So I decided to annouce: yet another MSX emulator :)
We decided to design the Nowind MSX Emulator V2 from scratch. Goals: a proper GUI for all platforms and a setup that focusses on simplicity
and usibility in stead of code that is so cool no one understands it :) It's also much needed because our currect design does not allow for 
proper emulation of screen borders and scaling of aspect ratio/.
