<P><H2>Interactive FAQ Added</H2>

<P>The 86 assembly programming scene has never had a really good FAQ--Frequently Asked Questions list. &nbsp;Matt Johnson started a good FAQ over a year ago, but I do not feel that it addresses what people <i>really</i> want to know. &nbsp;As one progresses through programming and learns more, it is harder and harder to remember what you want to know when you don't know anything. &nbsp;For this reason, I feel that an interactive FAQ is the solution. &nbsp;At the new <a href="faq.htm">FAQ</a> everyone can ask the questions that they want answered. &nbsp;Instead of asking newbie questions on the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/news/index.html#ticalc.asm-86">assembly-86</a> mailing list, you should read the FAQ here because someone probably already asked it and received a great answer. &nbsp;People (including myself) get tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so do everyone a favor and read the FAQ before you ask the question. &nbsp;And if the question isn't there, then ask it yourself!

<P><H2>Tilemap Section Updated [1/31]</H2>

<P>In response to many requests, I updated the
<a href="tilemaps.htm">tilemap</a> section to include some more important
info. &nbsp;I hope this clears up the questions everyone has been asking
about tilemaps. &nbsp;If not, feel free to email
<a href="mailto:david@acz.org">me</a> and tell me what I missed.

<P><H2>PIC2RLE version 1.5 released [1/6]</H2>

<P>I updated <A HREF="programs/pic2rle.zip">PIC2RLE</A> to version 1.5.  This new version elimiates having to
convert and compile pictures.  Bitmap files are now read, compressed and
written as .asm files all in one step.  If you are looking for a program
to convert and compress a title screen, download it now!
<br>

<H2>
Various Changes and Additions</H2>
I have updated a few things the past few days.  Please note that I
don't add a news blurb everytime I change something and don't change the
"Last updated" date, so if you think something has changed since last time,
it probably has.  I added a less on <A HREF="emudebug.htm">debugging</A>
with the <A HREF="emulator/index.htm">TI86EMU</A>.  If you've never
debugged on the emulator, you don't know what you are missing.  Read
it now.  In addition to changing the <A HREF="links.htm">links</A>
page so the new pages don't open inside my frames, I also added some logo's
that I borrowed (ripped) from the author's pages to make the page look
more interesting.  If you have a logo for your site that you would
like me to add, let <A HREF="mailto:david@acz.org">me</A> know. 
Please make it about the same size as the other ones, I'm not going to
put up banners or anything.  I plan on adding some more tutorials
when I get time, as I'm getting tired at looking at the gray text on the
contents frame.  As of right now, I'm just going to go through and
fill in the sections that Matt had planned on as best I can.  Many
of people have been asking about using external strings, so I'm going to
try and write up something about that sometime soon.  If you have
requests, let me know.
<H2>
Interrupt section fixed</H2>
While talking with Jimmy Mardell on ICQ, I learned that he is indeed correct
(isn't he always?) about needing a 257 byte vector table instead of 256
for IM 2 as Matt had orginally suggested.&nbsp; You can read his response
near the bottom of the <A HREF="interrupts.htm">Interrupts</A> section.&nbsp;
In other news, last week five of us started a new programming group, known
as Assembly Coder's Zenith, or ACZ.&nbsp; The members include&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:clems@mygale.org">CLEM</A>,&nbsp;
<A HREF="mailto:assets@eden.rutgers.edu">Dux Gregis</A>,&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:tbarwick@esn.net">Brett
Barwick</A>,&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:scheltem@aaps.k12.mi.us">Dave Scheltema</A>
and&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:electrum@fts.net">David Phillips</A> (me).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our new website is almost completed.&nbsp; We are in the process of merging
86 Central with the ACZ site along with getting a domain name.&nbsp; So
I will warn everyone right now that this site may move and/or change somewhat
in the next few weeks.&nbsp; I will keep everyone informed of our progress.&nbsp;
We will also try to announce anything extremely major at&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</A>,
so check there frequently as well.&nbsp; More information will be provided
as it becomes available.
<H2>
Minor updates</H2>
I made some minor updates to the site today.&nbsp; I found a site, <A HREF="http://www.cgiforme.com">cgiforme.com</A>,
that offers free remote CGI scripts.&nbsp; Don't ask me what that means,
I don't really understand it myself.&nbsp; But they have cool stuff like
counters and mailing lists there for free, so go there and click on the
banners or something.&nbsp; I am using a new counter from there, and I
decided just to leave it at zero and see how many hits we get from now
on.&nbsp; It was at ~17600 when I took the site over from Matt.&nbsp; I
might add a mailing list for notification of updates to the site and such.&nbsp;
They won't allow a full mailing list anyway.&nbsp; If you want that, go
to <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</A>.&nbsp; I plan on adding
some tutorial in the future after I wrap up some of my current projects.&nbsp;
If you have any suggestions for a tutorial, please email <A HREF="mailto:david@acz.org">me</A>.
<H2>
Site now in full operation</H2>
Matt has taken down the page from his server, which I just found out about
today.&nbsp; I have fixed most of the links that refer to files on my server
so that they now point to <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</A>
instead.&nbsp; He was emailed by <A HREF="http://www.ti.com">Texas Instruments</A>
to remove the ROM image from the site, so that will never be added to the
page.&nbsp; If you actually have a TI-86 and want a rom image, email me
and we'll try to work something out.&nbsp; If anyone finds broken links
or any problems with the page, please email me.&nbsp; I don't have alot
of time now to work on this page.&nbsp; Most of my time is spent on school
and programming.
<H2>
Page taken over by David Phillips</H2>
Matt Johnson has decided to hand this site over to me, due to his extreme
interest in Quake 2 and his calculator being stolen.&nbsp; I have moved
the site to my own internet provider, TFSnet, for several necessary reasons.&nbsp;
I plan on adding and revising much of the site, and to get the page into
full operation as soon as time allows.&nbsp; Thank you for your cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please direct any questions about the site to <A HREF="mailto:david@acz.org">david@acz.org</A>.
<H2>
86 Central no longer supported by Matt Johnson</H2>
I am no longer going to update 86 Central. I am going to hand over the
project to David Phillips (AKA electrum). On another note, my new interest
is Quake2. Our clan, DHT, has a web page located at: <A HREF="http://www.dogtech.com/dht">http://www.dogtech.com/dht</A>.
Also, my e-mail address has changed! I now have road runner, cable modem
speed baby! My new e-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:matt@acz.org">matt@acz.org</A>.
<H2>
Calculator got stolen</H2>
My calculator (TI-86) got stolen at school a few days ago (Sep 29) so 86
central is no more!
<H2>
10,000 Hits</H2>
I am proud to announce that this web page received 10,000 hits on July
25. My Last update was about one month ago. It is time for a July update
and I will work on a few more sections and some other changes/updates as
soon as possible.
<H4>
Rom and Ram Central Updated! Download a commented Rom Listing for ROM 1.2!!</H4>
By popular demand and recommendations of programmers from the A86 Mailing
list, I have updated Rom/Ram Central. I have redone the visual layout of
these sites in order to find rom calls and ram locations more easily. Not
only that, you can now download a commented version of Rom 1.2, thanks
to Joshua Gram. You still have to go through the same security check as
usual, since the Rom code is copyrighted material.
<H2>
Homepage complete!</H2>
I finally got around to making my own homepage. This is basically a two
hour page that includes a little information about myself. I also have
some C and Asm programming tutorials on there for the IBM/PC systems. My
homepage is at <A HREF="http://www.dogtech.com/cybop/">http://www.dogtech.com/cybop/</A>
<H2>
Minor Updates</H2>
As you may notice, I did some minor updates to the web page. I added navigation
links to the bottom of most pages so that frameless users can still nagivate
this site. I also spell checked my interrupt section because someone noticed
all my cheesy spelling mistakes. Once I get the time I plan to update Rom
Central and update my Asm FAQ, but it is already 11:00 PM today. I also
plan on reading over my old and new tutorials and re-check them for technical
accuracy and spelling mistakes. Oh and BTW, on the left I redesigned the
contents page. As you see, this will also host game programming information
and TI-OS stuff in the future. If there are any sections which you would
like to see please e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:matt@acz.org">matt@acz.org</A>
and I will take them in to consideration
<BR>Goodnight..
<H2>
June Update</H2>
Well school is out (finally) so now I will have more time to program and
work on this site. I decided to remove a few sections, such as the Games,
Programs, and Source sections. I feel it is redudant information and people
like <A HREF="mailto:brabeler@ticalc.org">Bryan Rabeler</A> already do
a excellent job of maintaining source/program/tools archives over at <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org">TICalc.org</A>.
I took out some stuff out of my site because I realized I dont have enough
time for some of this crap (like the source code section). I need (and
will) almost all my time in the TI-86 R&amp;D section. Enjoy!

<P>New Sections!!
<UL>
<LI>
Sprites section (fixed bug in PutSprite)</LI>

<LI>
Interrupt</LI>

<LI>
Advanced Interrupts</LI>

<LI>
Grayscale</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;

<P>Coming Soon! 86 Central addition - abilitity to download a commented
disassembled ROM version (didn't have enough time today to add that feature).
Also maybe a section on OP #'s and a few new (invented) sections like Optimization
and Debugging sections. See ya all later!
<H3>

Sound Demo v1.0 is an improvement on a program I wrote that will play simple
sound effects through the link port. You will need a 3.5mm to 2.5mm converter
(Radio Shack) and a pair of headphones to use this program. The source
code will be released soon along with a tutorial on how it works.
<H3>
Asm FAQ Update - Now a Huge FAQ!</H3>
My Unofficial Asm FAQ is now huge and comphrehensive. Although it is not
complete, I spent around a total of 30 hours working on this FAQ and it
is excellent. I am still working on it, however. You must stop what you
are doing and read through this, I didn't do all this work for nothing
:-). Send all additions, comments, questions, complaints, or corrects to
<A HREF="mailto:matt@acz.org">matt@acz.org</A>
<H3>
The Internals of the TI-86</H3>
Have you ever wondered what the inside of the TI-86 looks like? Check out
the <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~jrapp/stuff/">TI-Hardware</A> site,
which contains information on TI-86 hardware. This site shows you set by
step how to install an EL-Backlight, and has dozens of pictures of the
TI-86 being taken apart. Check it out!
<H3>
86wav released</H3>
Looks like someone ported <A HREF="programs/86wav.zip">Andreas Ess's PlayWAV</A>
routines and source code. Yup! You can actually play .WAV files! This archive
also contains documents and source code to. Most of the original documents
and source code is from Andreas Ess.
<H3>
A 3D game is in the works</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10 CELLPADDING=5 >

<TD></TD>

<TD><IMG SRC="images/vertigo.gif" ALT="Picture of Vertigo  - as shown in the TI-86 Emulator" ></TD>

<TD>SCaBBy, author of Rascall, is working on a new 3D game called Vertigo.
He got the idea from a game on an old british computer. The game is a 3/4
view perspective game where you control the direction and velocity of a
ball. You maneuver the ball on platforms and slopes, battling gravity,
and your objective is to reach the diamond (or heart). I have the pre-release
version and the game is really fun. Some of the future plans for this game
before he releases it is:&nbsp;
<LI>
More enemies&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Mobile power-ups&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
External level editor&nbsp;</LI>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<H3>
The many faces of the Zilog Z80 - A new perspective</H3>
What does the Z80 look like? It can be more then just a plain IC. There
is some interesting variations of what this looks like. For some cool pictures
of the Z80, go <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/3938/z80cpus.htm">here</A>.
The pictures do not even compare to the site itself, which is excellent.
The Z80 Offical Support Page is at: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/3938/z80_home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/3938/z80_home.htm</A>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Optic2000's Tutorial #4 has been completed!</H3>
Yes, the "long awaited" (yeah right!) tutorial has been completed. This
tutorial explains how the display works and gives the under the hood explanation
of the Findpixel routine. I also include explanations of some Z80 instructions
and a few programming techniques.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
A grayscale library?</H3>
Yes, that is not very new but I just got around to updating my page. It
is about time! Unfortunately, I have not had much time to play around with
this library. It looks cool, however, and I heard someone is going to implement
it in their next game. You can download this utility, among others, in
my Coding: Tools section.
<H3>
Official <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">TI-86 Emulator</FONT> HomePage is <A HREF="http://www.dogtech.com/cybop/ti86/emulator/index.htm">here</A>!</H3>
Steve Gordon and I have developed an official home page for his Win32 TI-86
Emulator. Any news, updates, and other information about the TI-86 will
be sure to be posted <A HREF="emulator/index.htm">here</A>. It also includes
fantastic screen shots of the emulator and some TI-86 asm games!
